0,Love my Echo!
1,Loved it!
2,"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home."
3,"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well."
4,Music
5,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."
6,"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."
7,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.
8,looks great
9,"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"
10,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."
11,I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times
12,"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"
13,"Love, Love, Love!!"
14,Just what I expected....
15,"I love it, wife hates it."
16,Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.
17,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.
18,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound
19,"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"
20,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.
21,"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."
22,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."
23,I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask
24,"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."
25,Amazing product
26,"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."
27,Sounds great!! Love them!
28,"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."
29,Just like the other one
30,Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good
31,I like it
32,"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"
33,The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.
34,This device is awesome!
35,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.
36,"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."
37,Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo
38,"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."
39,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"
40,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities
41,"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."
42,So far so good
43,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.
44,Great
45,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.
46,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."
47,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.
48,I love you so much
49,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .
50,"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."
51,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."
52,Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.
53,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.
54,like google better
55,Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.
56,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.
57,Great sound and easy to set up.
58,"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"
59,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
60,😍
61,Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available
62,"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"
63,Love this just wish it had a built in hub
64,I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!
65,How easy if was to set up.
66,Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.
67,You’re all I need...na na nana!
68,Does everything as expected and more.
69,"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."
70,Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.
71,Works and sounds great.
72,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music
73,Setting up
74,She doesn’t always listen
75,It’s awesome
76,"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."
77,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!
78,I LIKE IT ALL
79,I love it. It does everything
80,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!
81,I like it and still learning how to use it.
82,Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!
83,"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"
84,Works fine!!
85, 
86,Clear music
87,"Fun to use, good sound quality"
88,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.
89,"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."
90,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!
91,The speaker sounds really good
92,Good sound works well
93,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.
94,"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."
95,"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."
96,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!
97,"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."
98,Love it!
99,The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.
100,"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"
101,Love it!
102,"awesome thing, love Alexa"
103,It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!
104,"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!"
105,The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.
106,Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!
107,I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.
108,"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better."
109,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.
110,"Great device, responsive and helpful"
111,Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose
112,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."
113,Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.
114,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.
115,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."
116,"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!"
117,It's Alexa.... what else can you say
118,Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound
119,"Excellent product, set up with ease as well."
120,I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.
121,I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.
122,wonderful product and fast delivery!
123,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.
124,It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!
125,Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.
126,How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .
127,Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.
128,Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.
129,"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well."
130,Love our echo
131,"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."
132,"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."
133,I love having an Alexa!
134,So far I like it 🤓
135,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.
136,Still love it
137,Love it
138,"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."
139,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.
140,"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him."
141,Not much features.
142,"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."
143,Cool
144,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.
145,it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself
146,I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.
147,"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title."
148,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.
149,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.
150,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."
151,Love it
152,awesome.understands my kids
153,We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.
154,Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.
155,"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music."
156,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."
157,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!
158,"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"
159,Versatile and fun !!!
160,Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.
161,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.
162,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?"
163,so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app
164,"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?"
165,Easy to set up.
166,I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected
167,A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.
168,Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!
169,"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."
170,Good Value
171,Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!
172,Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa
173,BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.
174,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.
175,Sound quality
176,Sad joke. Worthless.
177,Entertainment
178,Very good quality
179,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
180,Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.
181,Alexa rocks
182,"Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."
183, 
184,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without."
185,Love it!! Great product!!!
186,Easy set up very user friendly
187,"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa."
188,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.
189,Everything
190,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.
191,Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.
192,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!
193,Love it!  So do the grandkids!!
194,"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."
195,Works as advertised
196,I love it!
197,"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."
198,"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather."
199,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.
200,A great device
201,I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..
202,Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!
203,Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.
204,Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!
205,It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things
206,We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.
207,Amazing paroduct
208,Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.
209,speaker sounds good
210,Absolutely love!!
211,The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.
212,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.
213,Home entertainment
214,"Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated."
215,"Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use..."
216,"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."
217,Great sound from a little speaker
218,We enjoy it
219, 
220,Cool
221,"Good quality, great sound quality"
222,Works perfectly
223,"Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker."
224,Love my Echo great sound very smart!
225,Sure did !! Love it !!
226,plays great
227,Works absolutely great
228,Very amazing product. Great sound quality.
229,Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁
230,"I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it."
231,"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"
232,"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!"
233,"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again."
234,I like everything about it !!!
235,Liked 100%
236,Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.
237,Our family really loves this new Echo
238,bought for my wife she loves it
239,Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.
240,Like it to do more
241,"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."
242,Listen music and set timer
243,I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!
244,Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!
245,Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.
246,"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller."
247,Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!
248,"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade."
249,"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"
250,"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music."
251,Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.
252,Enjoyed entire echo experience
253,Easy to set up.
254,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."
255,We are loving Ours very much
256,"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"
257,"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered."
258,"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"
259,Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.
260,Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!
261,"I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!"
262,Arrived as expected.
263,"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."
264,Terrific
265,Love my Echo
266,It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.
267,Works great!
268,"My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!"
269,"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights."
270,I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.
271,We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.
272,See subject line.  Love it
273,Love it!
274,Very easy setup.
275,"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!"
276,Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!
277,Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.
278,I love it!!
279,Works great! Perfect for my office!
280,Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -
281,easy to use--amazing
282,Nice product A+
283,We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!
284,Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.
285,It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...
286,"I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account."
287,Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!
288,Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it
289,"I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product."
290,Great addition to my Echo Plus!
291,the best
292,Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.
293,I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.
294,I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it
295,Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.
296,Very easy to set up and have no issues.
297,This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)
298,It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.
299,Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password
300,"Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far."
301,Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.
302,"Love it, love it!!!!!!!!"
303,Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps
304,I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information
305,"it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works."
306,"This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock.."
307,"Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color."
308,Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.
309,"Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!"
310,"Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover."
311,"I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money."
312,Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home
313,"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."
314,Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!
315,We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!
316,I am impressed with the sound quality.
317,"Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working."
318,"My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home."
319,"This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music."
320,The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions
321,"This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great."
322,great sound
323,Great
324,We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.
325,"Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet."
326,Very easy set up. Really enjoying it
327,"The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient."
328,more compact and a bit better than the original
329,I love it pretty cool.
330,I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.
331,This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.
332,"So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good."
333,Love it
334,Love it.
335,Glad I bought this.
336,"Like, all types of fun,music, and more"
337,I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.
338,Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it
339,"I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie"
340,Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.
341,Alexa hardly came on..
342,"Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!"
343,"I’m still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!"
344,Works awesome!
345,Works great.
346,From such a small speaker it sounds great
347,Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!
348,if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one
349,Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!
350,Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.
351,I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.
352,Works great no different than the new ones
353,This one's going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.
354,"Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go."
355,Works just fine.
356,Works great! Looks brand new! Love my new echo dot. I will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.
357,"For a refurbished item.. It works like its new... Which I love... Easy set up,  which I love. The only issue is the volume,  if you are listening while relaxing its fine,  but if you are expecting to do anything else,  I recommend  purchasing a speaker."
358,But not very loud
359,This is our 2nd one and we love it!
360,"So i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot, it's so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she won't understand you."
361,This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.
362,Gift for my man. He doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. Would prefer it cordless. Still works though for the purpose we bought it.
363,"This is our 5th Amazon Echo device.  We have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  You can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  Our Echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more."
364,"This small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are great.it changes my nest thermostat,and my Phillips hue lights.without leaving my chair."
365,We talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . There aren’t dislikes about this device.
366,I’m never disappointed with amazons technology.
367,Worked as promised.
368,I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!
369,not working
370,Has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.
371,I sure love Alexa!  LOL!  Thank you!  Great price and product!
372,It works
373,I'm an Echo fan but this one did not work
374, 
375,Bought for my bathroom to listen when I'm in the shower.  Love it.
376,Doesn't always respond when spoken to with promp word. I thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven't been able to do that.
377,Fast shipping and works well
378,I Love it!!!!
379,LOVE LOVE LOVE my new and free assistant!  :)
380,"Six words, &#34;Alexa, tell me a poop joke.&#34;"
381,It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund
382,Poor quality. Gave it away.
383,Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.
384,love it
385,We have five of them. Need I say more?
386,The speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. Besides that naw
387,It works great and sounds good!
388,"Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then."
389,Almost like having Star Trek in your home!  Fun to try and outsmart !
390,"This was an add on for my echo system, the refurbished product works like new!"
391,"Great for my office. I use this daily in many ways, to include spelling for me and background music."
392,Awesome. I love Alexa.
393,"I wasn't sure I really wanted one of these, but now that I have it, it is extremely useful.  Get one, you'll love it!"
394,"Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished."
395,Great Product fast shipping
396,"I bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often, doesn't wake up every time, randomly turns on but does nothing. Do not buy a refurbished Echo dot."
397,Perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished.
398,Dont trust this....
399,Perfect condition! I love my echo
400,Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.
401,"We just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! My son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. We all enjoy this one so much that I just bought a second one this week during Prime Deals Day!"
402,Divertido
403,Great product and works great
404,"Bought this for the guest room.  It's a radio, alarm clock, information​ center and so much more."
405,Great buy. Bought this to go with my Echo and love it. The speaker isn’t the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms.
406, 
407,Works perfect. Save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. Looks brand new.
408,Looks and works perfect. Glad I got a good deal.
409,Just as good as the new one I bought but $10.00 less.
410,I love it works very well
411,everything perfect
412,Good price. Prompt shipping. Has been working flawlessly.
413,"I love you, Alexa!"
414,"There's room for improvement on this. For the price, I cannot complain too much. I can still complain however, the audio is terrible. This is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s."
415,Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it’s awesome
416,"It's an echo, and it works.  For the price it's great deal. Have had no issues with it.  As with all dots, the speaker is a bit tinny, but good for a second unit, or if you are like me, you can attach it to an external speaker for more sound.Good buy"
417,Thanks
418,I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.
419,This is my third Dot. They all work perfectly and I use each one multiple times a day. Absolutely love them.
420,Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.
421,I already have the echo plus.  Bought this one for my bedroom.  Love the functions.
422,Simple set up.  Music everywhere.
423,Worked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.
424,Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.
425,We have a few echos already. Went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. It works great. I love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.
426,"I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry."
427,Refurbished but just as good as the new ones that I've bought.
428,Good as new
429,Granddaughter loves it
430,"The price is great.  Was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  Will buy some more. Want 1 in every room."
431,We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!
432,Thanks
433,Works great!
434,"&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!"
435,Started here with Amazon productsAnd I regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life
436,Have now used for several months without problem.
437,This is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.
438,Love
439,Love it just as good as a new one
440,Have had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.
441,Love the product.  Use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions.
442,A great buy
443,Was Leary about refurbished but work great.
444,"Very puny sound, but works great."
445,Great
446,"Exactly like new, can tell the difference from my new dot I got prior to this one, works perfectly. LOVE Alexa"
447,Works perfect no wear and tear on the device I love Alexa working on making my home smart 😂
448,Works good
449,The only thing I don't like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great
450,"Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!"
451,"Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn’t also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones."
452,Love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. And planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... I would recommend this to everyone!!!!
453,Love Alexa hope have her in every room soon.
454,The simplicity of use and setting up.
455,This is great! Got one for my Gazebo and one upstairs.
456,"Works great, never had any issues."
457,Does everything I have asked it.
458,Works great ..good sound
459,"I use this Echo to listen to music as well as a sort-of research tool. It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can't complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product."
460,Love it!  Great fun!
461,Love it!
462,outstanding I use all the time....works just like they say
463,"saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected."
464,"Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!"
465,Never would know it was refurbished.
466,So far so good
467,Looks and performs as new.  No complaints!
468,goes great with our echo
469,Works great just like the new one that i already had.
470,"This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it."
471,"Very fast service,  got what I ordered. Thank you"
472,Love it even though I’m still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.
473,None
474,"I have 2 Echos, one I bought brand new and the other is a refurbished one.Honestly, I can't tell the difference in performance and looks."
475,A GREAT PRODUCT...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!
476,It works
477,Does not work all the time
478,"Love it. Though, wish it was portable."
479,of course!
480,You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.
481,I got this for my mom . She loves it !
482,I love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.
483,Same as new
484,"A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited..."
485,"I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv."
486,I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected
487,"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed."
488,It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant
489,"Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha"
490,Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.
491,I've already returned it.
492,"The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems"
493,"Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it."
494,Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.
495,"I love Alexa! It's great helping me, making my appointments, playing the songs I like! What else can you do? Looking forward for more."
496,Got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe. We showering.
497,I have 3-Dots and 2-Original and this new one works perfectly.  Will buy all my future Dots reconditioned.
498,Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all
499,"Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet."
500,There's really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.
501,"I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I’ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! Even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! I’m happy with this purchase!"
502,Thumbs up!
503,Workreat
504,"There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one."
505,Works as expected!
506,No problems
507,Have these in almost every room. I really have enjoyed them. Works perfectly.
508,Purchased for grandson.
509,Like new
510,Happy with this as I was with the other 2 I ordered!!
511,"Love the dots, especially with the ability to talk from one to the other, these are really convenient. No issues with the refurbished as they are like new."
512,"Started taking on her own! Haven’t used it since I unplugged it that day. No one was talking, my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie Moana and completely scared the sh*t out of my daughter now."
513,It works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend
514,Great! Just like new!
515,"Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new. For $20 less than a new unit, I couldn’t consider this a better deal! I really love the versatility of the echo dot. Get you one while you can!"
516,Pleased with the order just what I wanted!!
517,"I think I now have 5 of these throughout the house. So convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever, wherever."
518,Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.
519,Love the echo dot
520,"This refurbished item was fine,but I wasn't aware that there is a fee for having other echos set up in the rooms.  However, it was missing the cordThank you"
521,"Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot."
522,It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.
523,"Great price, works perfectly. Saved the money on a refurb!! Would buy again!"
524, 
525,Very.god
526,Not good at all!
527,These are great. I bought one and then bought another right away. Grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. Highly recommended.
528,Just like new
529,"Worked as it should, still need to figure out how to link to other devices though, only set up Sonos which was pretty easy. Not the products fault, just have not had time to figure it out."
530,Very useful
531,"This is the worst Amazon purchase I have made. I am big Amazon fan...love the brand...unlimited digital music...prime videos...even buy my online games, music, and movies through Amazon. This app I have tried to use it make simple purchases -- to do anything. It is useless."
532,"Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size."
533,I bought two refurbished ones for work and home. They both work perfectly and appear brand new
534,Amazon doesn't disappoint.
535,Works great as a BT receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.
536,"Working great this far.  Can't tell it's not new.  Will edit for longevity in a year, that's the real test."
537,Amazing
538,i love everything
539,"This used “dot” works fine, it compliments my Echo."
540,Works like a new one.  Can tell the difference from the new one I bough and the refurbished one.
541,Well I’m a big fan of echoes these ones went I’m my bathrooms.  Works just great as expected 👍🏾
542,Purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to Alexa! Very responsive-can detect its “name” from all over the room.
543,This is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.
544,The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.
545,Love it.  Great product
546,it works good.  very satisfied
547,"I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also."
548,"Took me awhile to get it connected. I'm not electronically savy but now that it is, I love it."
549,cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.
550,Absolutely love it!
551,product stopped working after return time ran out
552,Second Dot work great for refurbishedThought it was new
553,Love these guys they work so great
554,"I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes."
555,I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.
556,Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.
557,Love the Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.
558,"Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?"
559,"Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you."
560,I like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire
561,Bought this for my son and it didn’t work. He had to return it.
562,Bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.
563,"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me."
564,I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.
565,Worked like new.  Will do it again.
566,The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.
567,"Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded"
568,Good as new!! Just like brand new! Save yourself some money. Get one!
569,Adding more rooms for convenience
570,"Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming."
571,"I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!"
572,Alexa's sister (my second dot)
573,"Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things."
574,"Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!"
575,Love it. It's like having a second wife.
576,So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!
577,Works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.
578,"Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things."
579,"great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it"
580,Worked just as good as the two new Echo Dots i preciously purchases.
581,I bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.She loves the guard dog feature.She says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house
582,I bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. Not working for me. Read instructions but not working for me.
583,It works
584,"Bought two of them and both work great. I'm not much on electronics running my home, but Alexa does all that I want and need to be done."
585,2nd one... more to come
586,Blue light blinks all the time
587,Fun and useful. We're still learning new tricks and useful functionalities. This is the future of human to computer interface and household automation. Just like Star Trek! Who knew it would be here so soon?
588,"Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo."
589,Works great!
590,Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!
591,A++++
592,Great product. Works well
593,Absolutly love it !
594,Bought my first echo dot and loved it so I got this for work. Absolutely love it!
595,works as promised
596,Works great with my existing smart home setup.
597,Perfect. Could not tell the difference from a new one.
598,I cant figure out how to use it.
599,Good sometimes can’t hear well
600,"I was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product, but with Amazon's guarantee, thought I would try it. Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great."
601,Not bad bad speaker for sound
602,"This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything."
603,We all love her!
604,I purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!
605,It doesn’t always  work
606,Good as new! Perfectly packaged and I have had zero issues with the dot.
607,Love it! Bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions. She is entertained for hours! Good buy in my honest opinion!
608,No issues...works and looks great!!!
609,This is a fun toy.  My daughter have me it.  It reads to me!
610,"Refurbish Echo Dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. Neat little gadget.(Drives my wife nuts!)"
611,"I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again."
612,Worked as advertised. Thanks
613,All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction
614,Works good.  Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products
615,Took a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.
616,Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don't know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to
617,I loved it it works great
618,Extremely low in volume
619,"I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don't know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL."
620,"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong."
621,"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??"
622,"Purchased as a gift,"
623,Love it
624,"Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker."
625,Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.
626,The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)
627,Worked perfect
628,"Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist."
629,I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known
630,"This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn’t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy."
631,Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine
632,Great little thing. Works better than siri.
633,It’s amazing I love it
634,Bought this for my son and he loves it.
635,"I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I'd still definitely recommend."
636,Very fun to use and having morning briefing
637,Arrived on time and works amazing!!!
638,"Just like new, set-up was quick & easy."
639,"like new, good refurbishing"
640,Love it
641,Love my echo dot!!!
642,I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.
643,great product!
644,"It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available."
645,Works great!
646,I love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.
647,"The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I’d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended."
648,Es perfecto.
649,Working good so far.
650,Working great and my daughter loves it!
651,Works great
652,I love it
653,"I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.  The top is black as shown, which I knew, but I did not realize the cord and plug were also black. I wanted a white cord and plug."
654, 
655,WORKS GREAT
656,Amazing!
657,Great product
658,Works perfectly
659,Perfect
660,I set up the Echo Dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely. DO NOT BUY refurbished!!!! I sent back for return the day after I received.
661,This Echo Dot is horrible. The volume on my phone is louder than than this device. My boss has one at this is not the case
662,Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!
663,Have had no issues with this refurbished unit. It performed expected. I would buy another one if needed.
664,Great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi
665,Works great - I put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv.
666,It was perfect
667,It looked brand nrw!! I have nothing to.complain about!! I will defently be ordering more
668,It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.
669,I love it!
670,"I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don’t get off the couch"
671,The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.
672,Bought this to go in my niece's room. You can't tell it's refurbished. It looks good and works like new.
673,Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.
674,Sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?
675,Best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.
676,I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.
677,"Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into. In the future I would have just gone with the full size echo."
678,Love our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.
679,Works great!
680,It has all I need for my life plans time date music
681,Seems to have trouble hearing me when I say the wake word despite being trained to my voice... Wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. Our google home mini has no problems hearing us 😬 and is much louder.
682,Love it!  Works perfectly!
683,I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.
684,I bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️
685,"Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party"
686,Looked Brand new works great. I love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new
687,My 2nd one and I use them all the time.
688,"Is working like a  new one for now, l have another 3 alexa devices lm a fanatic"
689,Echo is good.
690,Works great
691,Great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers. Hooked up wireless speaker to use working outside.This dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible
692,"Amazingly fun. My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don’t have it linked to my phone yet."
693,Works perfect! There’s no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that I have in my house. I’ll be buying the refurbs from here on out
694,Great product. Wakes me up every morning on time!
695,Like new.  No difference from new unused original.
696,"I have no complaints. As far as I know, these are exactly like new, just a little cheaper. Great!"
697,Perfect condition!
698,Like new
699,It works just as well as the new version I got as a discount with my Echo speaker. I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.
700,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."
701,"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."
702,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.
703,looks great
704,"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"
705,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."
706,I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times
707,"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"
708,"Love, Love, Love!!"
709,Just what I expected....
710,"I love it, wife hates it."
711,Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.
712,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.
713,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound
714,"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"
715,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.
716,"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."
717,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."
718,I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask
719,"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."
720,Amazing product
721,"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."
722,Sounds great!! Love them!
723,"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."
724,Just like the other one
725,Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good
726,I like it
727,"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"
728,The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.
729,This device is awesome!
730,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.
731,"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."
732,Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo
733,"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."
734,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"
735,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities
736,"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."
737,So far so good
738,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.
739,Great
740,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.
741,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."
742,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.
743,I love you so much
744,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .
745,"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."
746,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."
747,Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.
748,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.
749,like google better
750,Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.
751,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.
752,Great sound and easy to set up.
753,"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"
754,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
755,😍
756,Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available
757,"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"
758,Love this just wish it had a built in hub
759,I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!
760,How easy if was to set up.
761,Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.
762,You’re all I need...na na nana!
763,Does everything as expected and more.
764,"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."
765,Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.
766,Works and sounds great.
767,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music
768,Setting up
769,She doesn’t always listen
770,It’s awesome
771,"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."
772,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!
773,I LIKE IT ALL
774,I love it. It does everything
775,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!
776,I like it and still learning how to use it.
777,Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!
778,"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"
779,Works fine!!
780, 
781,Clear music
782,"Fun to use, good sound quality"
783,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.
784,"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."
785,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!
786,The speaker sounds really good
787,Good sound works well
788,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.
789,"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."
790,"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."
791,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!
792,"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."
793,Love it!
794,The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.
795,"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"
796,Love it!
797,"awesome thing, love Alexa"
798,It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!
799,"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!"
800,The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.
801,Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!
802,I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.
803,"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better."
804,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.
805,"Great device, responsive and helpful"
806,Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose
807,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."
808,Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.
809,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.
810,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."
811,"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!"
812,It's Alexa.... what else can you say
813,Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound
814,"Excellent product, set up with ease as well."
815,I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.
816,I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.
817,wonderful product and fast delivery!
818,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.
819,It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!
820,Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.
821,How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .
822,Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.
823,Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.
824,"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well."
825,Love our echo
826,"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."
827,"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."
828,I love having an Alexa!
829,So far I like it 🤓
830,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.
831,Still love it
832,Love it
833,"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."
834,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.
835,"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him."
836,Not much features.
837,"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."
838,Cool
839,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.
840,it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself
841,I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.
842,"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title."
843,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.
844,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.
845,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."
846,Love it
847,awesome.understands my kids
848,We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.
849,Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.
850,"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music."
851,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."
852,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!
853,"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"
854,Versatile and fun !!!
855,Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.
856,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.
857,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?"
858,so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app
859,"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?"
860,Easy to set up.
861,I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected
862,A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.
863,Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!
864,"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."
865,Good Value
866,Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!
867,Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa
868,BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.
869,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.
870,Sound quality
871,Sad joke. Worthless.
872,Entertainment
873,Very good quality
874,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
875,Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.
876,Alexa rocks
877,"Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."
878, 
879,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without."
880,Love it!! Great product!!!
881,Easy set up very user friendly
882,"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa."
883,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.
884,Everything
885,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.
886,Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.
887,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!
888,Love it!  So do the grandkids!!
889,"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."
890,Works as advertised
891,I love it!
892,"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."
893,"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather."
894,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.
895,A great device
896,I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..
897,Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!
898,Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.
899,Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!
900,It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things
901,We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.
902,Amazing paroduct
903,Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.
904,speaker sounds good
905,Absolutely love!!
906,The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.
907,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.
908,Home entertainment
909,"Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated."
910,"Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use..."
911,"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."
912,Great sound from a little speaker
913,We enjoy it
914, 
915,Cool
916,"Good quality, great sound quality"
917,Works perfectly
918,"Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker."
919,Love my Echo great sound very smart!
920,Sure did !! Love it !!
921,plays great
922,Works absolutely great
923,Very amazing product. Great sound quality.
924,Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁
925,"I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it."
926,"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"
927,"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!"
928,"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again."
929,I like everything about it !!!
930,Liked 100%
931,Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.
932,Our family really loves this new Echo
933,bought for my wife she loves it
934,Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.
935,Like it to do more
936,"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."
937,Listen music and set timer
938,I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!
939,Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!
940,Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.
941,"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller."
942,Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!
943,"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade."
944,"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"
945,"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music."
946,Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.
947,Enjoyed entire echo experience
948,Easy to set up.
949,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."
950,We are loving Ours very much
951,"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"
952,"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered."
953,"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"
954,Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.
955,Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!
956,"I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!"
957,Arrived as expected.
958,"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."
959,Terrific
960,Love my Echo
961,It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.
962,Works great!
963,"My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!"
964,"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights."
965,I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.
966,We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.
967,See subject line.  Love it
968,Love it!
969,Very easy setup.
970,"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!"
971,Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!
972,Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.
973,I love it!!
974,Works great! Perfect for my office!
975,Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -
976,easy to use--amazing
977,Nice product A+
978,We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!
979,Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.
980,It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...
981,"I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account."
982,Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!
983,Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it
984,"I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product."
985,Great addition to my Echo Plus!
986,the best
987,Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.
988,I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.
989,I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it
990,Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.
991,Very easy to set up and have no issues.
992,This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)
993,It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.
994,Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password
995,"Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far."
996,Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.
997,"Love it, love it!!!!!!!!"
998,Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps
999,I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information
1000,"it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works."
1001,"This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock.."
1002,"Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color."
1003,Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.
1004,"Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!"
1005,"Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover."
1006,"I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money."
1007,Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home
1008,"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."
1009,Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!
1010,We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!
1011,I am impressed with the sound quality.
1012,"Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working."
1013,"My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home."
1014,"This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music."
1015,The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions
1016,"This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great."
1017,great sound
1018,Great
1019,We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.
1020,"Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet."
1021,Very easy set up. Really enjoying it
1022,"The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient."
1023,more compact and a bit better than the original
1024,I love it pretty cool.
1025,I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.
1026,This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.
1027,"So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good."
1028,Love it
1029,Love it.
1030,Glad I bought this.
1031,"Like, all types of fun,music, and more"
1032,I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.
1033,Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it
1034,"I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie"
1035,Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.
1036,Alexa hardly came on..
1037,"Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!"
1038,"I’m still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!"
1039,Works awesome!
1040,Works great.
1041,From such a small speaker it sounds great
1042,Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!
1043,if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one
1044,Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!
1045,Very useful
1046,Great Prime Day Buy!
1047,I love Alexa!
1048,Alexa is easy to operate and set up.  Have had it for about 10 days now and love it.
1049,Great speaker with a lot of capabilities. Very fun to learn how to use it.
1050,I used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos
1051,"Don’t use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it’s used as a clock and standard dot’ish features."
1052,Amazing so far. Just got it the other day.
1053,"I like that it's smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did."
1054,"Worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock.  However, for the price it should come with the stand"
1055,"I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It’s a great shape and doesn’t take up a lot of room. I’m planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!"
1056,I love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to “Alexa” like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him “Echo.” Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don’t forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.
1057,"I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won’t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!"
1058,"I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It’s easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree."
1059,Honestly I like it but at the same time I don’t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it
1060,"Overall it's great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn't respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem."
1061,I love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!
1062,The thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use
1063,"Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!"
1064,"I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!"
1065,We absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!
1066,"We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting."
1067,"I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better"
1068,This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.
1069,Love my Echo Spot!
1070,It is very slow compared to the echo
1071,I love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.
1072,"Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen."
1073,New to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.
1074,"It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions."
1075,I love it.  It is so easy to use
1076,Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.
1077,Love it
1078,"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it."
1079,Very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone.
1080,I love my new Echo Spot!
1081,"I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!"
1082,Couldn't be more pleased. Amazon hit this one out of the park. Looks great and runs great. Love it!
1083,Responds easily and like the ability to do at night.
1084,Easy setup  Love it!
1085,"Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do."
1086,"I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera."
1087,Sound quality is disappointing.
1088,I love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.
1089,Great sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off
1090,The ease to use product
1091,"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good."
1092,"I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven't figured it all out yet, but so far it's pretty cool!"
1093,"It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs."
1094, 
1095,Love my Echo Spot!
1096,"Great deal, great product!"
1097,Perfect
1098,"i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: “Alexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc”i know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it’s cool now having an ‘appliance’ that’s always just there, and it doesn’t interrupt what i’m doing."
1099,"Bought this for my bedroom and the Show for my living room. Love them both. The Spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. Shows lyrics, photos , etc. I paired it with a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;Alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it."
1100,Love that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I’m happy I have it! Would recommend!
1101,It was a gift and the recipient love love loves it 😍💋💋💋💋❤!
1102,"Cool little piece of tech...we’re still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter."
1103,"I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future."
1104,"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful."
1105,So far so good.
1106,"This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen."
1107,"I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn't always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don't speak English anyways."
1108,Smaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.
1109,Echo Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.
1110,Nice
1111,I like it
1112, 
1113,"We've owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  We just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks."
1114,I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.
1115,"I like how small it is, but I’m still able to see my Ring cameras."
1116,Great for checking in on my son after school when I'm still at work.  Love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so I can plan my route accordingly
1117,Love it!! Super fun! Easy to use! My three year old even gets involved
1118,I returnef this item because it does not speak Spanish
1119, 
1120,"I am a hardcore fan of Echo. Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It’s fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch."
1121,Love this!
1122,I love being able to have Alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.
1123,"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn't as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who's at the front door.  But, it's great for the bedside."
1124,Fun tech toy
1125,Love it. Small with good sound
1126,"With the combination of this, smart plugins, and the Alex app I can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling Alexa to do it. I can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!"
1127,Great product
1128,"In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off."
1129,"I love this device! It's so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it's dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again"
1130,Hands free control
1131,"Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday."
1132,"It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I've added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it's ridiculous that it can't access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often."
1133,Setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock
1134,"Great product! Highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it, it sits much better on the desk."
1135,Eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring I don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can’t connect to my Spotify unless it’s premium and I’m in college and I’m not paying or that or amazon music so
1136,I am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can’t. It’s Spot to Spot. Can’t even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.
1137,LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!
1138,Love my Amazon products
1139,Love this
1140,"Love my spot. Have that , a dot, and a regular echo"
1141,Nice upgrade from an Echo Dot.
1142,"Works decent, wish it was able to answer more questions....need a better source for info but the rest works great!"
1143,I can't live without Alexa.
1144,Really like it. The screen is a major plus.
1145,"Didnt think id get an Alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other Alexa devices.  It can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  Its great!"
1146,I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..
1147,"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe."
1148,"It's fun to use, and makes my life easier in some sense."
1149,Love it!
1150, 
1151, 
1152,"I got my Echo Spot on Prime Day and love it. I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I'm still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!"
1153,Love this! Replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this.  Love that it dims at night. Very responsive to commands.
1154,Love my spot! She even more than I expected! Great size for a bedroom!
1155,So far so good. Just got it and I am trying to figure out all the things it can do. The product itself is very well made.. And easy to set up.
1156,After only a couple of days Alexa did not answer. I have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting.
1157,"Perfect! May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. Good job Amazon!"
1158,Is great. Use it for music mostly.
1159,It won’t receive calls and it’s really hard to call someone who has another echo.
1160,This is our first step into a smart home. Soon as I added one item to the grocery list I started loving it. My wife was so-so about it ‘til I opened rain sounds. She’s a convert. 😉 LOVE these and the dots.
1161,"Like the little spot,  now our guest room is Alexa enabled."
1162,We love our echo spots. We now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots. We do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general.
1163,It’s very smart and sweet design
1164,so far just ok
1165,Love this for bedside clock/alarm/radio.  Face can dimat night so it’s not bright for sleeping.
1166,Love this product I use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. The only thing I would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it's own. Like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.
1167,Love this. So glad I purchased
1168,I wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone. Works great and extremely easy to set up.
1169,The Echo Spot is great!
1170,We bot 2 on Prime day one for use as a clock/radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings.  Music sound is very good not as good as the Echo but way better than our Dots.  If we could only buy 1 Amazon device it would be the Spot.
1171,I bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table. They are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom. I can’t wait for prime day again to get one for my moms bedside table.
1172,"Fantastic product, absolutely love it!"
1173,Love these!
1174,I do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.
1175,still learning how to ise it but is DOES NOT disappoint. I’m giving to everyone for Christmas so I can “check in” on them unnannounced like they do me...just show up with no advanced warning!!!
1176,Very helpful with daily activities
1177,Exactly as advertised
1178,Its very nice
1179,"More than I expected. I use it for timers, alarms, shopping lists, calendar events, news, weather, and so much more."
1180,Great!
1181,I really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.Sometimes it misunderstands what I say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.
1182,Fun to work with still learning everything she can do
1183,Awesome. I love that it shows the lyrics of songs!
1184,Love the alarm feature...just tell what time.
1185,I think the dot listens better than spot.
1186,Had a dot and upgraded to this! I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions
1187,"Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed."
1188,Easy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it’s is great to be able to see him in between visits.
1189,I wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can't change it.
1190,Great size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!
1191,"I love it and it works great, the only issue is the “drop in” FaceTime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my WiFi for where we have it located in the house."
1192,"Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it"
1193,"I don't know why I like it, but I do. It's like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It's quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough."
1194,Quick and easy to set up
1195,I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99
1196,Great device
1197,I’m a fan of echo devices. I think it’s a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night
1198,"I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!"
1199,I enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I’m still learning different functions
1200,Meh
1201,Best looking Echo device. Easy to use
1202,A helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but Amazon will likely fix and improve it.
1203,we like it. very convenient
1204,I love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It’s small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.
1205,The amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!
1206,love the spot
1207,Easy to use easy to set up
1208,I love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday. Alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when I ask.
1209,"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless."
1210,Great deal on prime day
1211,no problem
1212,Excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atención la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a través de la utilización con Alexa. Me sorprendió gratamente. Muy recomendable.
1213,I love love it !
1214,"Purchased this on Prime Day and I absolutely love it!  I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent."
1215,"Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can't read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don't need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light."
1216,"Great product, and i like the screen for a alarm clock"
1217,"Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this."
1218,"A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn't appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself."
1219,This product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze. The screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news!
1220,Works well and was easy to set up.
1221,"Love my spot, it now acts as my new alarm."
1222,This is the one of my favorite Amazon devices.  Have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock. Perfect addition to our home of Alexa devices.
1223,"Wasn't so sure about bringing &#34;smart technology&#34; into my home, but I'm hooked! I love the sleek look of the Echo Spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use. I also love that it scrolls the news, local weather, and give suggestions of what to ask Alexa. I use this as my alarm clock, speaker, and have it sync'd with the Etekcity Voltson Wi-Fi Smart Plugs to control the lighting in my apartment."
1224,Love it
1225,You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!
1226,Love it getting use to it and Alexa is getting use to my voice . Sometimes she doesn't answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong. Over all I haven't had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn't listen to those reviews.  And paid attention to the Apple guy .
1227,product turns on randomly and sometimes at night
1228,I used it as an alarm clock  i lov it
1229,It was much smaller than I was expecting for the cost.
1230,I’m amazed
1231,Alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on Iheart radio or Spotify I want. Plus when I do get smart home devices she’ll be even more useful to me! She’s really helpful with answering random questions. The small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it’s nice to have something to show time and pictures.
1232,Fun so far...still learning how it all works
1233,"I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn’t watch a movie I’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching “Jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!"
1234,We love the echo spot I use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iHeartRadio radio while getting dressed!!
1235,It was easy set up.  I use it more than I thought.
1236,I would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through “things to try”. If Amazon would make this a setting I would change my review to 5 stars.
1237,"I am a small business owner with no staff. With the Alexa driven Echo Spot, I feel like I've hired my first assistant! My Echo Spot keeps me organized, updated, and assistance when I need information that will help my day run more smoothly. I love my Echo Spot so much, I bought 2 more for my kids who love their Echo Spot too! I highly recommend this product.Suggested improvement for future versions, make the Echo Spot wireless. 😊"
1238,"Bedroom clock , ask questions,  weather reportsAlarm clock ⏰. Music 🎶 download music"
1239,Speakers are not as loud as Google Home
1240,I haven't figured out how to make or receive calls.  Device tells me I need to register and I do not know what to do.
1241,"I need to get some better controls for custom displays and the ability to make my own clock, but that's asking a lot. In general, great device; glad I got it."
1242,Great buy!
1243,"Gave it my daughter for her birthday, she loves it! Sound is amazing, she plays music on it constantly. Worth every penny. This is the third amazon device purchased, we have 2 echo shows and now the spot."
1244,"I use the product as an alarm clock. I love being able to set my schedule for the week and not worry about it. When images are shown, they are cut off. Little because its trying to fit it into a circle."
1245,Love the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered
1246,"Great product and I would give 5 stars - but you can't scroll face cards without having the stupid &#34;try and ask Alexa&#34; suggestions pop up.  Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons​ part."
1247,"Love that I have command access to news such as Bloomberg TV, NPR, etc.Highly recommend that you gain access to Alexa app before setting up Device and get familiar with key features/services...such as setting up your daily commute.If family and friends have Spot...then it’s a great substitute for Skype and Face Time...you can always “drop in” when missing loved ones or just to catch up."
1248,good size screen and gets good range for voice commands. sometimes it picks up weird commands when I'm watching tv though. Great product for the price if you don't need the big show screen.
1249,"It is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions."
1250,Best thing I have ever owned! Started with the dot and now added the spot and I love iy
1251,I love it the coolest thing since sliced bread
1252,"This product is a complete waste of money. When you ask Alexa a question ""she"" either doesn't know the answer, gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of Wikipedia!"
1253,"Honestly it's no different from the Echo dots I already own,  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song I'm listening too i really don't see the difference."
1254,"I got this for my husband on Prime Day. He loves it as his alarm clock and smart device. This is our 3rd Echo device, and we have them all connected throughout the house. Although you can deactivate the camera, we also chose to cover it since the device is in our bedroom. I'm not comfortable with having a camera in the room (no, we don't bring our cell phones in the room)."
1255,"Great product, what they don't tell you is that once you allow a &#34;Drop In&#34;  they can drop in anytime!!!  While they are sleeping, while we are yelling at them, while anything."
1256,"I have two. One in my computer room and the other that I move around out on the deck. Not great for watching video, but it can be done. With the added sound you don't get from the Echo Dot, it is perfect for the location I have it in. Add whole house music, and you have just arrived in Nervana."
1257,Surprisingly handy. Wish it had more options geared towards it being on your nigh stand. Like an even dimmer setting.
1258,"I was on beta list for Alexa, Have a Show, an original Alexa, 4 Echo's and I actually like this the best, even more than show"
1259,Love it!
1260,"I was contacted by people in India. Were they suppose to charge me $79.00? It was very hard to understand their instructions. They did have control of my computer and network. I, also, bought a Cloud Cam but do not know how to make it work with Alexa."
1261,"I have the dot and Echo Plus, this one can't seem to &#34;hear&#34; me as well and doesn't do as much as I expected."
1262,Bought this for our son as his birthday present and he loves it.  Often find him jamming to music in his room now  :)  He loves the options for the alarms and we have his weekday alarms set to repeat and he gets to sleep in on non-school days.
1263,Great product!
1264,I love my echo spot!
1265,Excellent purchase!!
1266,"What a great little gadget for the house. You ask and it delivers, period. Well done!"
1267,"I switched to google. The amazon helper is more for shopping, and google is the tasks assistant."
1268,My favorite Echo. A more than adequate replacement for a clock radio.
1269,"The Echo Spot is compact, nice sound and camera quality. Makes it great to video chat with the family when I'm travelling for work. Ease of use that the youngest member (10 years) has no problem talking to Mama on the video chat and understands the important of digital security."
1270,This echo spot is great I love it
1271,"The voice recognition is amazing, perfect companion for the bedroom."
1272,"I liked it, perfect size, the screen is really clear,  and elegant."
1273,"I am not easily impressed with electronic goodies. But...OMG this is by far the coolest thing I have ever had.  It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn’t have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it."
1274,"This product is beautifully designed and I no longer have to hide an Echo device away like I did with Dot. It would be nice if Amazon would lose that camera though, which I have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious."
1275, 
1276,Love this little dot with a screen.  Super easy to set up and easy to use.  Instantly connected to all my other echo products.  I also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it.  Recommended.
1277,ALEXA IS NOT AS SMART AS SIRI! CANNOT CANCEL SNOOZE AFTER ALARM GOES OFF. HAVE TO CANCEL PRE-SET ALARM FOR WEEKDAYS.
1278,"Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL"
1279,"I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts. Sadly, it continuously scrolls the &#34;Things to try&#34; and won't stay on the clock face. Amazon is about to get this one back."
1280,Hands free calling in the house. I misplace my cell phone all the time so this is a real blessing. Really enjoying the streaming music.
1281,"Got for elderly parents,easy for them to use.just instructions could be more informative"
1282,This thing is great. Fantastic alarm clock.
1283,"We love using it for bedtime reading on Audible. It's very kid-friendly, and I can see liking it in the kitchen while I'm cooking since it's small and unobtrusive. We like it better than our Echo Dot."
1284,very nice gadget. love it's look.
1285,Not happy with the Spot.  Reset numerous times.  Seems to be in slow mode.  Have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me.  Even after talking with support I still do not have “themes” in the menu to choose from!
1286,Husband loves it!
1287,***Love it***
1288,Love the Spot - Awesome little guy with precise video - I’m saving to buy one for my mom on the east coast - The Spot changes Everything as far as keeping your loved ones connected!!!Well worth every Cent!!
1289,"All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made."
1290,Excellent
1291,"item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise"
1292,Awesome item that I had to buy two!
1293,"For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn't thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo."
1294,It has replaced my clock and Google Mini on my nightstand.  Outstanding little device.  I hope an update will give a simple face and font color options for the clock.
1295,I love the echo spot!
1296,It every ting I thought it would be plus more.  This will be going to my MOM right after I get through playing with it.
1297,The most fascinating thing I've ever bought
1298,"Sound quality is less than a dot, microphones don't pick me up as well as the other models (i have Echo and Dots).  Picture quality is good"
1299,Awesome cute and smart!
1300,Product forces user to review Alexa Things to Try. There is no way to disable it.
1301,"Absolutely love it. After much persuasion from a friend, I finally gave in and bought one. Let's just say that the moment Alexa enters my life, I turn around and tell Siri to get the hell out."
1302,I love love love it.
1303,GREAT
1304,"This is my first Alexa device and it is so fun to discover all of the ways to use it. The biggest con with me is the ""drop-in"" feature, it's pretty creepy"
1305,The best thing since sliced bread!
1306,"Can’t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it.  I didn’t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app."
1307,"Would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;Things to Try&#34; screen!!!  I should have read up on this before buying the Spot.  Amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!  It is SO extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see &#34;Things to try&#34;."
1308,Love it. So great to use!!!
1309,"I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should."
1310,"I never thought I was going to be THAT person that is completely connected. I purchased this and another Echo product on Prime Day and fell in love.  I have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  I have already used this for morning briefings from the News while I am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  Note: I did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn't impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!"
1311,"LOVE love love this!  I have an echo, and several echo dots, but love the video with this and the clock.  I no longer have to wake up and say &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, weather&#34;  I can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed."
1312,After purchasing my Echo Spot to add to our other 4 Amazon Echoes...I am very pleased with the Echo Spot...I use  it with our Arlo Security cameras and Ring video doorbell and works without any problems...
1313,Disconnects often
1314,"It does so much more than I knew when I bought it. It pretty much runs my house, helps me fall asleep, takes care of my schedule, and entertainment"
1315,"Love, love so far. I just received it Thursday. I unwrapped it, set it up, & immediately programmed it. No problem with the reoccurring things to try. I set it to rotate once and shows time like I want. I love the low ambient look at night."
1316,"This is the best Alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. It sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. The screen makes all the difference in the world."
1317,"I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good."
1318,You're going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand.
1319,"Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don't have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, ""I don't know that skill"" even though I've added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut."
1320,Such a handy item to have on my night stand. She reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views.
1321, 
1322,"I got this on Prime day and figured I'd see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration."
1323,"The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it’s not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds."
1324,Love it!
1325,"I LOOOOOOOVE this thing! :) Watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen, but other than that it's a GREAT chachki toy :)"
1326,We gave the Echo Spot as a gift to my mother in law.  She loves it.  She can play music of all genres!  Easy for her to use.
1327,Very easy to set up. Does what is said it will. Very satisfied so far..
1328,"Great product, need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify, time, weather, etc.. in Hong Kong, but works fine now. I used it as alarm clock + music in bedroom, love it."
1329,"I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders."
1330,This product just looks adorable in any room and I love it. I recently just bought my mom one as a gift on Prime Day and she can't wait to use it.
1331,love my spot
1332,"Loving this way more than google home devices. I've been using for a couple months and if you're an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I'm using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household. I felt happy after adding this to my house where as I felt stupid using google home."
1333,I like it as an Alexa device but its small.
1334,What a wonderful little Alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best
1335,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!! Bought it on Prime Day, then had buyers remorse, but once I got it, it was Love at first sight."
1336,I like the Echo Spot because it fits into my decor and I can also sing along with my favorite songs
1337,Best bedside clock and assistant I have ever had.
1338,"Omg where do I start, I LOVE THIS THING! None bad to say!"
1339,Works as described.  A+++++
1340,Get rid of the &#34;Thongs To Try&#34; screen!!!!!!!!!! Numb nuts!!!!!
1341,"Have not used it yet. But I'm sure it's as great as the others.. I can not get over how amazing the echo , echo dots are. This has to be some of the greatest technology that has ever came out."
1342,I am very excited and happy with this. It was a breeze to set up and my favorite feature is reading my Kindle and going to sleep to Thunderstorm music.
1343,Still learning to use these things.  They sure are smart!  haha  She started reading a book to me yesterday.  Get one.  I like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at night.
1344,"I highly recommend the spot! I have it connected to the kasa camera and it is so convenient to just ask spot to, &#34;show me the camera&#34; when someone is at the door. Love it! As soon as amazon has a good sale on these again I will be getting another one! Good job Amazon!"
1345,The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.
1346,Great to wake up to music and being told the weather.
1347,"Bought this to replace a Sony Dash (remember those?) after Sony decided to pull support from it entirely. It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can't turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don't want to see as it cycles through content screens. A software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and don't want to see in the content rotation."
1348,Can't turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll. This  is a big promotion device for Amazon.  Packing it up and sending it back.  They really want to get in our heads.  Enough already.
1349,Love everything about this product I bought two one for my household and one for my mother in law just so we can video chat with her and for emergency and it’s easy to use for older folks.
1350,This thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying “ready for setup”. It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...
1351,The echo spot is really great. I just got it and is easy to set up. I do have one problem. When the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town. Sadly there is no way to make this the home screen. The home screen is just the time😔. I spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. I am disappointed because I wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate. I am hoping they will do something about this. Other than that it’s great
1352,"The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose to force users to view their “things to try” and Trending”.  This greatly depreciates the value of the product.  Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon."
1353,"The Echo Spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient! It reminds me of any appointments, warns me about traffic snarls, and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists."
1354, 
1355,"Come on - it's amaonmazing!  It's way more than a smart speaker.  It's my wake-up alarm, my security blanket, and infotainment center all-in-one.  It's my connection to the world during night hours when I'm mostly sleepy or zonked-out Zzzzzzz...  I can still access the world without my reading-glasses late at night.  It sounds amazing for its size.  It can hear me when I'm far from awake (mostly).  As they say, &#34;this is a must-have device&#34;.  Yep, that is a true statement."
1356,"Got one for me and for my son on Prime Day. We love them! I want one in every room, but that would be excessive."
1357,In one word: Amazing! Best tech purchase I have ever made as it controls all devices in my house and even my pool!
1358,I’m leaving this for those who don’t have enough of an attention span to read instructions.  You can stop the screen rotations.Swipe down on clock screenSelect settingsHome & clockHome cardsRotate onceProblem solved
1359,Very nicely constructed. My wife wanted a second for the kitchen so I order a second one.
1360, 
1361,"I love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  Let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  Yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on Amazon Prime Now during Prime Day and it was delivered same day for $99."
1362,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18
1363,"I love my little Echo Spot, I have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy. The round screen is an interesting choice and I'm not sure I like the look but it is growing on me. The speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product."
1364,"It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. ."
1365,"Having received this as a gift, I am writing my initial thoughts: (compared to my google home mini)PROS:  Way easier to setup than the google home mini.  I was able to connect ALL of my smart home device (unlike google) without any issues.  Making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me.CONS:  Need to enable 'skills' to get more functionality.  Google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo.  Could not connect this to youtube."
1366,Love it
1367,Well-made product.Echo Spot - White
1368,"Installed on my back porch, works very well!  I did have to get the wall mount for it, which also works well."
1369,"Thank God, and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep. I'm a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room. Not this guy. The Alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great. We enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like. Video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that's to be expected. Audio quality is much better than echo dot."
1370,"I love this thing. At first I thought it wouldn’t stay on the clock and that I would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it’s very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up. Love it"
1371,"Got it and, as expected, ITS GREAT! Almost a swell as my SHOW."
1372,"Love this thing. People think I’m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock. But I don’t care!! For me, waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it!! So glad I don’t have to deal with my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited to say “Alexa, turn off the lights” (smart plugs get here soon!) Got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom."
1373,"I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I’m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I’d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices. I really have no complaints, I’m being nit picky at this point. Worth every penny!"
1374,Surprisingly good beefy sound out of this thing. I think it might shape up to be one of my favorite echo devices. I have nearly all of them. ;-)
1375,"Given as a gift to my wife, to compliment my echo.  She loves it."
1376,This is a gift.  But I have one and love it.  The words to songs are great and the I live the face I chose for the clock.  This is my favorite echo (unless I am listening to music).
1377,"I’ve had this for a little over 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It’s so easy to use. I’m basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more. The screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand. I don’t know how I lived without it so long. If you can’t decide whether to buy it or not, GO FOR IT! You won’t regret it!!"
1378,Fairly useless.
1379,Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable—expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.
1380,"Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!"
1381,"When we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? Well, I'm so glad we did! We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It's so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy."
1382,For the size of the screen this thing should be $25
1383,"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower."
1384,I bought this for my mother and she loves it! I want to get one for myself now!
1385, 
1386,Invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF
1387,"4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I'm finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I'm not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it's just the sound. Sometimes I'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That's one reason I bought the Echo Show."
1388,"I bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and I love it!!! She can call all her family members with just her voice, play games, even watch a video and I love that I can “drop in” on her any time to see how she is doing. She lives all by herself. And I feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to Alexa for help!!"
1389, 
1390,"I love this thing! It plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms! If you’re considering purchasing one, get it. It’s worth it."
1391,I think it can read my mind
1392,Perfect
1393,"Love my spot! My favorite feature is the &#34;Alexa, start my day.&#34; I love that I can hear the weather, traffic and even the word of the day! It even goes right into my favorite podcast while I get dressed!"
1394,Works. Replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.It took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.Maybe it should said something during the setup process.
1395,"Works great I love it, grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol"
1396,Gift for husband.  Great!
1397,I had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone’s schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I’m still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!
1398,"I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I'm now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn't."
1399,"I’m not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase. I got it as a gift from my kids for Mother’s Day...  It was not bought from my account. Lil bit creepy 😑. I haven’t really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. So that part meh. The other things it does are no different than the other Alexa products."
1400,I love love love love it!  I feel like I have a talking computer that tells me EVERYTHING.
1401,Love the Echo Show.  Being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful!!
1402,"It seems to work well.  Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.  This problem is caused by Google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  This even effected my smart TV.  Anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we'll see what happens when we hand them out."
1403,Love listening to music. Still trying to learn everything it does.
1404,Very pleasedSimple to figure out
1405,"just what I expected,already have 2 other  shows"
1406,Very good
1407,"Excellent to listen to my music, my audio books, and look all my cameras in and around my house."
1408,"Alexa is fun! I’ve added smart home aspects, my friend listens to Spotify, my husband enjoys interacting too."
1409,Tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country
1410,"It,is,what it is and than some. Sounds great too. On,y thing I dont like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon  I asked echo show to show me camera and didn’t know what I was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can’t dhiw u what’s recording hmm"
1411,"Used for personal use. We like hearing weather, news from CNN, and various playlists."
1412,Love it!
1413,I like the echo show its the best! big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it.
1414,"Prime day pricing was good, but the show is very limited.  No video services available except Amazon Video.  No Netflix or YouTube.  Alexa is very limited also, not nearly as useful as Google."
1415,"works great, has great picture easy to setup and use.."
1416,The fact that she can help me find my phone when I am at home alone is worth the price of this device
1417,"I LOVE THIS ITEM... I UNDERESTIMATED THIS ITEM, I HAVE ANOTHER 2 IN MY CART ... BUT I'M WAITING FOR THE SAME DEAL AGAIN!!!, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!"
1418,"I love using my Echo Show for music, it sounds amazing! Unfortunately the video quality when video chatting isnt great, my husband and I video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated. I'm still learning to use it but so far so good."
1419,Love it!
1420, 
1421,Oh I love my Echo Show and the video news spots
1422,Waste of money over the echo generation 2.  You don’t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it
1423,No you tube wouldn't have bought it if I known that
1424,This is our second echo show.  We have a home in Mexico and one in the USA.  Now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other.  We can also drop in on the houses when we aren’t there to check on them.  We use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes.  We also have echo dots in various rooms.  We love all this technology!  We ask her many questions and she plays music for us.
1425,Needs to play YouTube and prime video and maybe Netflix. But it has good sound
1426,We love our Echo Show!
1427,Great product
1428,"I love this device. I upgraded from the Echo Spot. I just wish I could customize the clock on my screen to analog, to mimic what I was used to in the echo spot. Also, there is better sound quality on this device."
1429,"Love this thing.. Best toy I've bought myself in awhile.. So far I have a smart plug connected running my Ac.  And the wifi light bulbs.  Baseball scores, weather are  cool but the music is the best feature."
1430,"This thing is a lot cooler than I thought it would be.  I mostly have used it to read me audiobooks, but I also love that I can see into the camera while I'm at work."
1431,"I’m really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more."
1432,We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.
1433,Works well with optional cameras.  Conferencing is good.  Still feel like Bezos is spying on me.
1434,I can connect my smart lights and my phone. And any other smart device. It's just so convenient that I highly reccomend it to anyone who have the disposable income.
1435,"Love, love, LOVE!!!"
1436,Love all my Echo products. I like the video phone feature on this. Can check in on our cat when on vacation.
1437,"Works exactly how you would expect, right out of the box. I love being able to not only hear, but now see, what I need on this device. I loved my regular echo, but the Show is just so much better!  It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!"
1438,I absolutely LOVE this!!!  I have it in my kitchen so I can use it for cooking. The speakers are amazing!!!
1439,I've only had this a week but so far so good.  We are enjoying it.
1440,"Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product."
1441,Very excited to see what it can do
1442,"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating ""things to try"" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off."
1443,"I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre."
1444,"Got this as a gift... so cool!  I can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  And much more!!!"
1445,"I do love it. Was easy to set up so far, but I wish it has a little more in the set up instructions. There is still a whole lot more I would like to be able to do with it and I have no idea if I can or not with it. But I really do like it."
1446,This is my second one. I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.
1447, 
1448,"Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money."
1449,I love it. It does everything.
1450,Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.
1451,"I purchased echo about 2 weeks ago , I love this product, I would definitely recommend"
1452,"I'm loving my new Echo Show. The video screen adds so much more value and potential. Movies, tv shows, song lyrics, all extra features that are available with the Echo Show. Oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics."
1453,"My wife has been using Skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  Since her father is 88, it's a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, but he does.  When I saw these on sale, I jumped on them.  My wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but I told her these just work - like the video phones I saw at the New York World's Fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  My wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.  It just works, like a telephone - imagine that."
1454,Bluetooth sound is great. Videos are crazy. It’s an amazing device.
1455,"Great item for knowledge, directions, music,laughter and more"
1456,very nice-needs some work
1457,Very cool!
1458,Enjoy using it.  Great sound.  Love the shopping list
1459,"The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don't want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them."
1460,We held off purchasing an Echo but couldn't resist during Prime Days.  The Echo works great and it's nice to have the screen.  There is still a lot more we need to learn how to do.
1461, 
1462,"Love it very much, still learning everything that my Echo can do, but am really enjoying the whole process."
1463,Love it!! Still learning all the possibilities.
1464,I love the echo show awesome speakers I love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far. Also being able to read what's on your shopping list to do list and notifications
1465,Nice works great
1466,Easy to set up and sooooooo many things it can do.  Just awesome!
1467,Met every expectation I had
1468,I like it
1469,"Unit is working great, but it is a true PIA that products today are shipped without user manuals. Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show's capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won't. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants."
1470,It's a fun item to have.  Has a lot of udefulness.  Big negative is that it doesn't use Google (or any real search engine) to get answers or find information.
1471,I was pleasantly surprised! It’s awesome so far
1472,"Alexa Show is amazing. My wife hated that I bought it, thought we didn't need it and after a day she fell in love with Alexa too lol. It is so convenient for setting timers, listening to music, playing music for the dog while im not home, connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties, playing movies. I love it!"
1473,"Do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either.  It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.  Really can not recommend this item at the current time"
1474,"It makes talking with your grandchildren so easy, especially for the little ones.  Outstanding product!"
1475,Great product.
1476,I already had purchased the Echo and a couple of Dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped.  I am very glad I did.  The versatility of the video screen is outstanding.  No regrets!
1477,"I purchased the ""Show "" to keep in touch with my daughter and her family after their recent move half way across the country.  It is wonderful seeing their faces during our conversations."
1478,"My difficulty is I dont have a cell phone,and now you cant download the alexa app on a Mac book air.  SO I am stuck, unable to program my echo show properly. In my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done. and the echo show does it. every time i ask for something I am referred back to the alexa app.on your mobile device, which I cannot access.To me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function.Every thing today is pushed to the phone,  because the phone has been made accessable,  to all those who wish  to gather information"
1479,Great in the kitchen.  I love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  Also great for listening to music and watching shows on Amazon Prime Video while I cook.  I subsequently bought an Echo Dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom.  I created a group so I can play music on both of them at the same time.  I plan to add more speakers in the future.
1480,"Excellent quality, very good sound, great deal on Prime Day."
1481,So far so good.  Neat to have a visual version of alexa's responses. Nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to.  Flash briefings have good videos.  Speaker is much better than a dot but not the highest quality
1482,It’s fun
1483,fun so far. learning to use her.
1484,works great.. nice sound and picture
1485,"This product is even better than I imagined. I love the timer setting, it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to, and i love shopping list feature.  My family enjoys the games too! It’s made my life a little more easy! Alexa is my personal assistant. :)"
1486,I love it.
1487,Very disappointed.  Alexa doesn’t hear me and doesn’t respond to my requests.
1488,Highly like my eco show.no complaints
1489,"love it! so glad we got it on Prime Day, although now having it, I would totally pay full price for it!"
1490,"Great addition to the Alexa family.  Nice having the &#34;visual&#34; part of pics, recipes, etc."
1491,We love it!!  We use it every day and are finding new ways to use it the longer we have it!
1492,I have been through 4 Shows now.  And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders.  I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo.  Just on the Show.  It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.
1493,Easy set up
1494,"Pleased with the Echo, it is loud and can hear my voice and understand much better than previous versions."
1495,"Love it!  Great to request music and be able to see lyrics.  I had a dot, but this is so much better."
1496,What we liked most was actually seeing the words to song. Least would be I guess I expected a little more from her than is currently available.
1497,"I’m just learning about this product, but what I know I love !"
1498,Easy to use!
1499,it does what it needs to.
1500,"I love this product.  I'm not very computer literate but everything is voice controlled.  I use this to keep in touch with my daughter, she lives out of town.  Now we just drop in on each other. It's like we are living net door to each other."
1501,I enjoy seeing lyrics on the screen for different Amazon music stations
1502,love the Echo show great in  kitchen  for recipes
1503,"Alexa is pretty dumb ,,,"
1504,Only problem is my slow internet. I really like the speaker on it. Having tons of fun with it
1505,"Love my Echo Show. Alexa is amazing and now on the Show &#34;she&#34; can display lyrics, photos, etc. The speakers are amazing and fills the room. Bought on Prime Day so got a great deal, so worth it."
1506,LOVE MY ECHO SHOW.  Everything about this device is wonderful
1507,"Used to have fun with. Great to play music, turn on lights and who know what else."
1508,"Works great , seems to be a delay bringing up ring cameras but sound and video quality are good"
1509,Works on great i  use it with my Arlo security system
1510,"this is so fun! I really enjoy using it. I have it hooked up to one of my lights so I just tell Alexa when I want that on and off. also, it connects to my Spotify so I just have Alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended. I feel like there's even more I can do with this, so I'm excited to use it more!"
1511,"Upgraded from an original Echo on Prime Day and so far I love it. I'm sure I have a long way to go to maximize its utility,  but for now I owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing. Who knew Post Malone actually used words?!"
1512,You can't access YouTube! Why do consumer's have to pay for this argument! Why can't we just have a good product that offers what we need?
1513, 
1514,Still learning about the Echo show but so far we love it. My 9 year old loves to cook and especially with his Aunt that lives out of state and now he can connect with her and they cook together.
1515,"I love having this on my desk. The fact that I can video with friends, listen to music with the words right there, and see my Amazon Cloud Cam feeds from one location is pretty spectacular. I got this one sale too, which was stellar. It has me thinking I need another one for the front room."
1516,Love it!
1517,Love my echo show! Great sound and picture. Does a great job thing in my entire echo collection!
1518,Can’t change voice of Echo
1519,Does everything I could ask and more. Great product.
1520,I like how clear the screen is. Hi resolution
1521,It is so easy to use and is everything I hoped for
1522,"I love the Echo Show. I’m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect. Some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense. We carry devices with cameras all the time. The only difference here is that the item is stationary. My family and I also find the drop-in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy. It’s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I’d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn’t included that.We are an echo-loving household with two dots, three echos, and now two Shows. I wouldn’t be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones. Thanks, Amazon!"
1523,I love it it is awesome
1524,Very Good to be able to listen to Every single song at any time in Amazon's vast library. We're only just beginning to know everything Echo Show has to offer. Well worth the price!! Alexa is very helpful.
1525,Love it!
1526,"Great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time, trivia, etc."
1527,This has been perfect for being able to see my canary cameras and that’s exactly what I wanted! I have been happy with all my Alexa’s because we have several and this is a great addition.
1528,I really love this item!  So much fun!
1529,I agree ...YouTube should be on there.
1530,"We like it a lot, sound is better than the original echo, the bass feels deeper.  The screen is cool, though, havent got a lot of use out of it though."
1531,Good sound! The capacity of join different apps to make work your smart home
1532,"Great addition to the Alexa family, just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds. Don't get me wrong I don't regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of $100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking."
1533,I've had previous experience with the echo Dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the water!It's great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud.
1534,"Love the echo show, can keep I can video chat with the kids and grandkids. I have it in the kitchen, so when I run out of something I have Alexa to add it to my grocery list. I use it for everything. Was very easy to set up"
1535,I’m really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen. There’s an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions. Make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please!
1536,Love it l. I plan on getting an echo for the kitchen.
1537,It does not pick up my voice unless I yell most times.
1538,great love it
1539,Amazing!
1540,Fire HD does so much more.  Over priced pair of speakers.
1541,"Seems to be a good product but, unable to play music in sync with my Sonos system. Sonos doesn't seem to recognize it at all."
1542,Great product.  Like the apps that I can connect to it.
1543,I love it now able to talk to my grandson with ease and the picture quality is great
1544,"Love it! Easy setup and I can ‘Drop in’ on my daughter and son-in-law who live in St. Louis anytime. Everyone loves to have their mother drop in, right 😎"
1545,Fun
1546,I use this to control my smart home.
1547,"Show has been great. Still learning what it can do, but being able to watch videos, talk face to face with others are not features."
1548,Wish I bought one for work too
1549,"Very intrusive, so I turn it off"
1550,Love the echo show
1551,Works well. Not thrilled that most of the apps have to be paid for seprately.
1552,Video calls to Mom
1553,"Love being able to see, as well as hear things.  Sound is better, too!"
1554,I love it
1555,Just like any other echo. Doesn’t disappoint
1556,"Nice picture good sound but the mics are not as sensitive as a dot, my dots can hear me from across the house the Show does not, that being said I LOVE the show!!I can watch TV and movies while in tg ed kitchen, have the News playing or Music....love....it !!"
1557,"I basically use it to play music  and tell me the news..its sometimes hard to communicate with it, if i dont say the command correctly, but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should."
1558, 
1559,Upgraded from echo to echo show.
1560,"I love the Echo Show!! I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought ""this is a cute novelty,  but I'll probably never use it"". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier."
1561,"So far I’m very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there’s so much it can do that I haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can’t beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I’m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  So pleased in fact, that I bought a second one!"
1562,"I like everything, about this ! Im still learning how to use it!"
1563,"It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device."
1564,Really easy to use
1565,It's great sound and video quality
1566,The way the music sounds is poor quality
1567,"It does everything the Echo does, and more. Although I haven't and probably won't use the video functions. I had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. It does not and is very limited. I would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. It also always has a line that says &#34;Tell Alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. I would like to see that go away, but it won't. Sound quality is good, not as good as the big Echo, but good enough. I bought it on sale and think I got value for what I paid. I would have been disappointment had I of paid full price."
1568,Love my echo show!
1569,I enjoy this thing. Its learning
1570,Am very happy now that i can see.
1571,All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.
1572,"So far, I like it.  It is better than I expecting it."
1573,Doesn't always respond to the wake word. This is my 3rd echo product and I have to say I am A little disappointed. Alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries.
1574,Good product.
1575,"After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to."
1576,It f****** sucks
1577, 
1578,Love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.
1579,"This thing is awesome for grocery lists, paired with the AnyList app. The flash briefing is very good too. My only complaint is that once you pause something, Alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing. Forever. All in all, definitely worth the purchase."
1580,"Works great, video call function nice when communicating through drop-in"
1581, 
1582,As you can see Echo Show is in kitchen. It far exceeds my expectation. There’s a wealth of information about any topic. If is customizable for sound and video. I also have Echo and Echo Dot. You can group them and have hole house music. Still not done exploring all it can do love it. Perfect for getting recipes so you can see them while you’re preparing to cook.
1583,Fairly easy to use
1584,Absolutely LOVE my Echo Show!  It is awesome and works great with my Ring Video Spotlight Cams!  Music on demand and so many more features that I have yet to explore!!!
1585,Absolutely love it! I use it for everything!I tell my friends and clients that it’s the daughter I never had. I ask her to do something and she doesn’t complain! I wish I bought the 2package deal :( I truly needed one in my work room. I kick myself for it.
1586,"We love having this in our kitchen! Very convenient to look up recipes, listen to the news, or watch prime video while I'm cooking"
1587,"Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better."
1588,The greatest
1589,Love it
1590,This is my fourth Echo (original and two dots). It's the best.... Decent speaker... Fun graphics...
1591,I loved talking it out of the box and being able to easily set up.
1592,Easy to setup and use. The ability to play video is huge addition on Alexa device family
1593,"Echo Show is said to work with certain apps but,NOT!!! Cozi state works with Echo Show, but the Cozi Family’s doesn’t very well, Amazon needs to go back to drawing board, it would be such a needed piece of technology, but it lacks the essential, please fix. Cost of the Echo Show was  marvelous . Got Echo Show to take on shopping list but that is all so far, adding items to list has long lag, and it not my router being slow, my provider speed is !GB, speed not a problem, but before new items is updated on Cozi is very slow. Help is needed to get it updated to A1 working conditioning."
1594,"All the music I can listen too, Also the movie I can watch I can see my ring doorbell ."
1595,No enough video options
1596,Great sound
1597,I took advantage of prime Friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one.  I enjoy the features it comes with. I'm sorry I didn't purchase two of them  Well worth the money.  Its looks great on my nightstand.  Every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music.  Happy customer!
1598,The music...the shopping list and the sound....
1599,"diversity, so many things to see and hear. Wealth of information"
1600,Love it. Thanks Amazon. You guys rock!!
1601,"Disappointed that this device Is not able to access youtube as of Dec 2017. I wasn’t aware of that when I purchased it. I’ve had problems with my device. The voice stops working throughout the day. I can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info I asked about, but it’s like the device gets stuck in the process. It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I do that, it starts working again. So irritating. This device could really be a great device if Google and Amazon would act like grownups..."
1602,Returned from repair with No repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.  The site gives no option to complain from the page.I have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.
1603,Love it!
1604,I like the design and the visuals!
1605,"I haven't had my show very long or used it a lot, but I love it! I use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time. I also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. My son gets a real kick out of that!I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn't have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven't thought of!I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven't figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son's dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don't have video screens!Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free. So now he is a bit worried to use it again. That needs to be fixed.I do have to say that all in all I am very happy with my Echo Show!"
1606,I have not had it very long. It's my first Alexa thing. I sure like what I have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with
1607,Works great and has been fun to use.
1608,This is the best of my echo devices and I own a spot a dot and echo
1609,Having the large screen really majes this an enjoyable experience. Only thing it’s missing is youtube.
1610,easy to use.
1611,"I bought it to go with my security camera system, but it did not perform like I thought it would. It doesn't alert us when someone is at the door. Also, I can't talk to the person at the door through the echo show, only through my cell phone."
1612,"Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they “updated the firmware” when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then (2) weeks later the glitch starts up again!I love the show but I’m getting really frustrated with the glitching."
1613,Super fun !! I ty is what I was expecting
1614, 
1615,I love this so much!! Alexa is even better when she can show you things!
1616,I have the echo but got 2 show. 1 for my Daughter. Absolutely love it. Especially for the video chat.
1617,"I've had an Alexa Dot for some time but I'm really enjoying the Alexa Show. It's great to have a visual whether it's a song or the weather. Played Jeapordy, but I'm not good at it. You do learn trivia and no one's watching! Love that recipes are visible and movies are available. Haven't had it long enough to try everything."
1618,Got this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don't need to go see who at my door anymore while I'm gaming.
1619,"We originally got the Show to video chat family members, and it works great for that. We have found that we really like checking things hands-free like the weather and recipes. So far we have really liked the Show, and would recommend it!"
1620,Easy setup. Was up and running in minutes. The learning feature is outstanding. Now I know why Amazon is so far ahead of the competition.
1621,"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could."
1622,"quite nice...clear, great sound."
1623,"Versatile use, can watch movies or news.  Able to use as remote for vehicle.  Or use as a communication hub for the home.  Great produc!!!"
1624,I bought two.  One for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state.  We love it!!
1625,"Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.  AMAZON, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this SPAM!"
1626,The best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.
1627,"It’s my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes."
1628,Echo Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.
1629,"Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price."
1630,Love that you can play music and see the lyrics.  Connected to my echo dot I enjoy listening in multiple rooms.
1631,"I love Alexa and when I had the chance to add Show to my home... I jumped at it.  But... I'm a member and my Show doesn't know I paid for the extras with my Echo (now in the upstairs bedroom.  If I am supposed to pay more for having Show added to my home, then I'm afraid to ask &#34;What's the point?&#34;"
1632,Purchased as a more &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.
1633,"Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could be better. Must be on the same bandwidth as other Alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz."
1634,"I am pleased with the Echo Show, from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather. The color on the screen for my photos could be better."
1635,Echo Show is my personal assistant! Awesome!!!
1636,"The packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! We have 2 dots and an echo plus already. Now we have the show and we love it. An echo for each room!You can also say &#34;Alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. This is good for sleeping."
1637,"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates."
1638,"My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot. Each are great and have their uses around my house. I highly recommend all of these products."
1639,Really like the show me feature. I also like video calls with others.
1640,"I love this device.  I bought it simple so that I can have an alarm clock with my Amazon Echo.....and during Prime day for the price you couldn't beat it.  But, I have Sonos and Big Ass Fan lights that I am able to control with this device.  It's perfect and getting better all the time."
1641,The ase of participating with Echo
1642,"I like the weather options but Alexa search compacity needs improvement. She aint no Google. Alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. Currently Alexa doesn't do YouTube either. This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.  International radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything."
1643,Love it!!
1644,LOVE!! i still haven't figured out all the best things we can do with it.
1645,"Easy to use, Answers all my questions,Hands free, What's not to like , It may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, I enjoy it totallly,, Keeps your home connected"
1646,This product is amazing! I love it!!! Best Buy!!! Only thing missing is Bluetooth
1647,It’s great
1648,The Echo Show works great. I enjoy  very much.
1649,Works with Blink video cameras.  Does not work with You Tube.
1650,I love the simple set up I love the fact that it has all the answers to most of the questions that I have I bought one for everybody in my family so we can all be like the Jetsons
1651,The only draw back is it stops every once in awhile in the middle of a song .
1652,Great product!
1653,"Echo is my teacher English, he is very funny,but sometimes he does not listen to what is said."
1654,Ight
1655,awesome product! I am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and The Show is now my favorite device!
1656,"We’ve had the original Echo for quite some time and just recently added the Show.  It was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  The Echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  I look forward to expanding on that capability.  We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.  I haven’t used the Show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon."
1657,These things are great!
1658,bought two of these. One for my kitchen and the other for my sewing room. Its great if I need a recipe or need to know how to do something.  I am still learning everything it can do.
1659,"Love how it shows the song info on the screen if playing... also time, notifications, news, etc!"
1660,"Alexa takes some getting used to, but the picture quality is great, the touch screen is very responsive and smooth. Speakers are better than expected as wellFour stars out of five"
1661,Love it
1662,"I like the option for white, but it’s bizarre that it comes with a black cord. I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the “white” option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white."
1663,I am very pleased with the Echo Show! I love that it has so many nice features. I highly recommend it.
1664,The ease of set up and overall functionality makes this Echo show worth every penny.  I especially like setting my background screen and being able to set affirmations that I use as personalized reminders.
1665,I love it!  I wanted it primarily for the kitchen.  In addition to other common services I wanted it to use ALLRecipes and Cook's Illustrated recipes
1666,"Easy to use. Great for recipes, listen to music, see movies, movie trailers, so much to do...."
1667,I love being able to see information that Alexa gives.  When notifications are turned on it lets you know when your order will be delivered and it also tells you what the order is. You can use the Echo screen to pull up details of your orders. You can use the Alexa skill to make calls from uhyour Echo.
1668,Great sound and video!
1669,"really like it,"
1670,"Love my Echo Show!! Now I can listen to music, get recipes, and so much more!!! I highly recommend the Echo for everyone!!"
1671,"Easy to set up. Plug it in then make some selections for your preferences such as language, temp C or F etc. I am getting more familiar with it and will be adding my calendar and appointments."
1672,I like the variety of stuff that the echo show offers.
1673,I love it!!!
1674,I wish it did more with internet searches.  I do like the feature it has
1675,I bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great.  I understand the frustration of not having YouTube though.  Still good to have-love seeing the words to songs and if you have the Ring doorbell-you never have to get up from your chair...laziness at it's best!  LOL  All in all- a great product with good speakers.
1676,Good smart home gadget.
1677,Love the speakers and the screen.
1678,No YouTube
1679,I loved everything about this item. Quick response time and very sensitive to me speaking from the other end of the house.
1680,Bought it for my mother
1681,It is great. But it would be better there was a way to use headphones with it.
1682,"So far so good,  much better sound than my Echo Dot"
1683,Clear screen and great picture
1684,I love it. It is compatible with many of my cameras and it does everything that the echo dot does.
1685,I have it in the kitchen. Great for news or music in the a.m. I can video call my daughter and grand kids. I really dig it!
1686,"I absolutely love this thing. And I love AMAZON because my Echo Show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and Voila, a new one to replace it is on the way. I was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data. Alexa still talked but I couldn't watch movies. SO HAPPY that Amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all."
1687,"Works well for recipes and references. Nice device, just the right size."
1688,Works well
1689,"Works fine, I just realize I don’t need this because I don’t use it."
1690,"It has a screen, microphones, speaker, and alexa lives inside.  Yup it is an Echo Show.  Expectations met."
1691,This is very user friendly
1692,👍🏻
1693,Let’s start with.Dislikes: Now I want to buy 7 more to have them all over my house.Do I even need to add my likes now? HahaAwesome fun and useful. Nothing else to say.
1694,"An outstanding piece of Technology, I use it everyday for information, scheduling and general information.  Awesome Amazon, keep improving with AI."
1695,This was an impulse buy and I am super happy I made the purchase. I love this so much I immediately bought my parents one. now we can video chat easily! I love all the features and how easy this is to use and set up.
1696,I like it
1697,"Great product, great price on Prime Day.  Thanks Alexa!"
1698,Still trying to figure out how to link to Bluetooth speaker.
1699,Wish there were more skills
1700,"Still learning it. We have just started integrating the smart devices in our home with the Echo product line. We now have the Show, the Spot, two Dots and a kids Dot. Having trouble getting them to call each other but still working on it."
1701,"Great improvement over the original Echo.  Like the ability to see lyrics to songs, watch Prime TV and get other visuals.  The little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination."
1702,Love it!
1703,"Sound is great,video is great. Now I just need to learn everything it can do. Where can I see videos (youtube), listen to music. watch the news"
1704,Great addition to our Alexa family. Great video also.
1705,"If you belong to amazon prime, I would think that you could watch any video on it that was in the library.  You can with prime music"
1706,Starting my day!
1707,Nothing to dislike and it does a lot more than I expected
1708,I bought this specifically so my wife could look at our Arlo security cameras from the bedroom when I’m at work. The system worked for three days and now it just gives me a error message. Very disappointed due to the fact that they advertise that these systems work together. I gave four stars because it does everything else very well.
1709,Love it
1710,It is awesome. I love being able to turn my lights on so I don’t have to walk into a dark home. I also get to video chat with my nephews who live states away by just asking Alexa to call.
1711,Super easy set up! Great features! FUN!
1712,I love the size and the videos are a good quality.  The sound is awesome too.
1713,Home
1714,Bought for my older grandparent to help with reminders. Would recommend to anyone with someone in their life with dementia or memory loss. Helps my grandmother remember to take medications and do daily task. She loves it because she can listen to music and ask questions
1715,Kids like it for games.  Showing the lyrics for songs is neat.
1716,Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps
1717,Glad I upgraded my aka
1718,Still leaning about it. The price was right!
1719,"I own two dots, a tap and a show. I love the echo show. Sound quality is amazing compared to the dots. I use mine constantly to create shopping list, kitchen and laundry timer, and news updates. But most of all I have the all throughout the house and I play music throughout using the group settings"
1720,I absolutely love my Show!
1721,Echo Show - White&nbsp;Great new addition to our Alexa home solution and now I can call back home and video chat directly from my phone. Great way to stay in touch with family.
1722,"It's an echo with a screen, hence still needs work. Has me considering google home now."
1723,Great product
1724,"I like the fact that the messages are visual now as well as audible.I am puzzled because it will light up and make the &quot;notification&quot; sound but when I ask Alexa to read my notifications, she tells me that there are no new notifications.  This has happened at least once a day for over a week now."
1725,While I loved Alexa....this is a whole new level. Love it. Fun to watch movie trailers. Weather is so much more complete. When you listen to music....the lyrics appear. Still discovering all Echo Show can do. Highly recommend. Takes Alexa to a completely new world.
1726,Nice product but as intelligent as we thought or had hoped.
1727,The tech isn’t there. It doesn’t understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio
1728, 
1729,Love it!  We have other echoes and love those so I bought this on prime day!  No regrets.  Love that I can connect to my Ring and see the front door.  Yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along. .
1730,"I love it! Plays great music, movies, and so much more. I does lag when u want to see your arlo security cameras thou. So far so good. Wish it had a longer cord."
1731,Love the echo show. The video quality is good and of course sound is good too.
1732,Love it. It is in my kitchen so I can watch Prime Video while cooking.
1733,Love all of it!!!
1734,Great Product
1735,We are very pleased with this item. The display is clean and crisp and easy to read. We enjoy trying the suggested things to try asking Alexa. We use the timer feature quite a bit and have added our calendars and contacts. We are still exploring the many skills available.
1736,Device has great speakers and the screen quality is phenomenal.
1737,"We now have a dot, spot, echo and show and love the show and spot best. The show has great sound and my wife loves the display for weather, recipes and sing alongside. Super deal."
1738,It doesn’t play you tube videos
1739,"Was working great útil 1 week algo, í have it for a month, but it started flickering,  and in the support forums they say it is a known isue,  but it has more the 4 months reported and There is no solución."
1740,We like the video calling feature. We got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well
1741,The sound on these is terrible. It’s like a tin can. I love my echo but this item is awful.
1742,I have been waiting for the Echo Show to go on sale and it was worth the wait. It was easy to set up and start using
1743,Bought this on Prime day
1744,"This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh."
1745,Love it to play music works great for finding recipes. Need more family to have adapted machines to see
1746,"It seems a little less intuitive then the regular Echo Plus. It's also a little harder for it to pick up what you're saying.  When combined with the other four we have in the household, having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones, so we had to rename this one.  Overall it works well, but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original Echo Plus."
1747,This is my second Show.  I like them very much.  I use mine for music and my Arlo security cameras.  I can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice. They are exceptionally capable devices.  I highly recommend them.
1748,Love seeing everything in the display!
1749,"I love this thing.  I enjoy watching the daily news, play music with lyrics (most songs), ordering my coffee..etc"
1750,We use Alexa primarily for listening to music and checking the weather. We are still learning other ways to use her. Everything has been ready and hands free so far. The speaker has great volume and sound!
1751,Plug n Play set up is simple. Added battery base to make it portable. Looking forward to using the hub.
1752,Great speaker i n this! I love this so much more than my alexa tap! It’s definitely fast in response and just so much prettier
1753,She's [Alexa] a bit dense and still learning the way I phrase things with my NY/NJ regional accent.
1754,Great sound and easy to set up. Purchased the Echo Plus because it had a built in Hub and would make it easier to connect to devices. I am hooked on Alexa!
1755,"I like the built in hub. Plus the unit sounds great, just wish it had a volume control on it."
1756,Happy with Echo Plus. Having fun learning what I can do with it.
1757,Love my new Echo Plus
1758,Omg we love it!
1759,Have had this around a week.. I love that I can control items in my house even if I’m not there.. makes me feel better about being away from the house and people don’t know that we are gone.. Alexa has not disappointed!
1760,I did not know it needed to be plugged in to work. So far my experiences have been positive.
1761, 
1762,"Was surprised to learn this can be used as a Bluetooth speaker for phones and tablets... it probably lists it in the description, but I missed that part!  It not quite the surround-like quality of a Bluetooth speaker in the $100+ range, but its very good none the less.  And with even basic access to Amazon Music there is a lot to listen to.  There's a huge number of things Alexa can do, learning more every day."
1763,It's fun to use... I love novelty gadgets... And Alexa really works well for me...
1764, 
1765,Awesome device to have in home.  Full of very useful information.  Don't have to us e my phone to answer spur of the moment questions.
1766,I like the echo plus it's wonderful the least thing I don't like is it doesn't turn off every
1767,"We love our Echo Plus. We like listening to music,the sound is great. All the features are nice! I do wish it was wireless so we could listen to music outside!"
1768,It’s a great product and easily set up just have to get it in sync with your personal set up
1769,Using as a hub and music.
1770,"Still need more AI built into it to interact better. It needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding / answer needs to be right. You can't keep stop Alexa and ask again and again. Also, it should be able to access the wikipedia, dictionary in many areas with better and fast access.Needs to hear us better. Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.  Connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well.Good product with good sound quality, but needs more AI built in."
1771,"It was an excellent purchase. Echo Plus has sound quality, good size, I love it... I it!"
1772,Did take me about 6 hours to set it up I have a Galaxy S9 phone when I got used to the system setup it was in seconds edit my light bulbs adding a string of lights simple easy
1773,"Great speaker, great microphone response.  Loving my purchase and the beginning of my smart home."
1774,"This is my 3rd Echo and with the built in hub it works great !  Now I have an Echo in the Family Room, My Bedroom and My Home Office."
1775,I don'r know how to use it yet.  Need more explicit directions for the electeonically challenged.  I did not get the feee lifht bulb that was part of the package.
1776,Is amazing I have all 3 and I love this
1777,"Awesome product, very responsive!Alexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music. It uses the Bing search engine instead of google. If only the two could combine. It would be a perfect product."
1778,"I am pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of Alexa. The unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with TV or music playing.I did pair two smart  bulbs and they go on, off and dim with ease using voice or app. Fidelity is very good for the size.My only regret is that I would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue."
1779,"We went to a Best Buy with the intention of buying Alexa products, instead were talked into the Google Home products. Bought the Google Home and the Home Mini... has trouble from the start setting them up, and they couldn’t understand my husband (Scottish accent). After days of the “oops, something went wrong” command.. we returned them and bought the Amazon Echo Show and the Echo Plus... so easy to set up! It connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate. They both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message. We have loved these two products and should have gone with what we intended in the first place! You won’t regret your purchase!"
1780,"Tons of features and skills, and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music. You still need some work on the AI, in responding to random questions though. My Android phone is far better at those... with the Echo I still get a lot of &#34;hmm, I'm not sure&#34; or &#34;I don't have an opinion on that.&#34;"
1781,I like Alexa
1782,"So far it has been fun to use and learn how to deal with Alexa. I am still learning and finding out what can really be done, plus I am in the process of making my house a smart house, so there is no much to control with Alexa yet."
1783,I like the whole thing so far
1784,"Same specs as regular echo, but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights, etc."
1785,"It's a great product with many good aspects, it easy to setup and control with intuitive straight forward instructions. The included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly. I very much enjoy this product and recommend it."
1786,Not that much different than the one we had.  Alexa is still stubborn. LOL.  We ordered it on the Prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs.  When we called she said they were sold out.  Felt bad about that.  Now we have to buy light bulbs.
1787,To have ability to play Amazon Music outside for patio gatherings. I also used blue tooth to connect Echo Plus via Alexa App on my tablet to an external speaker when/if the party extends into the yard. I have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices.
1788,We got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device ! I had to get a friend whos an IT guy to come help me setup
1789,"I love every aspect of the Echo Plus, I wanted it for my office. The light was also for my desk lamp."
1790,Great hub
1791,"This is very hard to review because I am part of the  problem.I am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when I am not home.I am computer literate, iTunes literate, Amazon literate, as well as countless other programs, but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to Alexa.  I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored.  I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.So far, I like what I have been able to use but I'd like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.Karen"
1792,Very satisfied with the purchase. The package came in good time and was just as expected
1793,great sound easy set up looks cool
1794,Love the Echo Plus!! Much better versatility than the first generation Echo. Intercom and voice-controllable smart bulbs are awesome!
1795,My new BFF!
1796,Alexa didn’t know answers to many questions we asked. For example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money
1797,"For now, I love everything. So cool with my music and flash briefings, 5 star Echo"
1798,Great product. I have two and may want to buy a third!
1799,So far we have enjoyed it.  The only problem we have is I have not been able to call one of my sons with it (the sad part is he is the one who gave it to me:( )
1800,Love it
1801,I have had no problems with my Echo Plus. Would purchase it again.
1802,Great
1803,I love it.  You own personal secretary.
1804,"Not perfect but very good! A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!"
1805,Pretty cool. I have only begun to figure out things she does.
1806,I have the google home that I really like. The Echo plus I think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it.
1807,I love this device. Makes life easier the more you figure out it can do.
1808, 
1809,"I love my echo plus. I haven't one bad thing to say. It controller music when I need it too. With a great sounding 360 speaker. I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say ""Hey Alexa"". And if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. This is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort."
1810,"Amazon Music is great. Love the ability to create my only playlists. Has great sound, not up to the standard of our Bose but very good."
1811,Home entertainment.
1812,Great product I just wish it had some sort of equalizer... The bass is a little much
1813,Its work perfect an I must introduce the rest of the device to complete the functions.
1814,"I decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the Echo Plus to control it.  I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn't know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work."
1815,This Echo Plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life!
1816,"I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top."
1817,"I'm so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend's home, he played some music while talking about the product.  I love the sound & love that all I have to do is tell Alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  I haven't been able to listen to my CD's for a while since I have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it's not an issue any longer."
1818,"After we learned to use this (we are still learning), we are very pleased with Echo Plus"
1819,I Love it !! Used one like this in Philly while visiting my son and decided to buy my own on Prime Day !
1820,The speakers on these devices are surprisingly good. The functionality of each echo device is fantastic.
1821,As advertised.  Connected my smart bulbs with no problems.
1822,It works perfect!
1823,"Love warehouse buys. If this was just in good used condition, then new must be newer than new. Seriously, this one was perfect, not a mark on it anywhere. Great buy!"
1824,Alexa is awesome! The first day I got my Echo Plus I found out things that she can do that I didn’t think were even possible. I highly recommend this product. Along with all the accessories.
1825,Ease of set up. I’ll have fun sitting up other features as well as making my house a smart home.
1826,I try use with yale lock but isn’t work
1827,IT SEEMS TO BE OK BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WEAK AND I CAN NOT SEEM TO GET IT TO WORK. I AM GOING TO GET MY TECHY FRIEND TO HELP ME OUT AND I WILL UPDATE YOU LATER
1828,"I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out. And I found it odd that my dot wasn’t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network."
1829,Love everything about this....
1830,Perfect for controlling my tp-link smart devises
1831,Love this thing. Easy to setup and  looking forward to adding more smart devices to my home.
1832,Got it specifically to work with the August Smart Lock and it connected to it with ease.  Definitely ties the Smart Home together.
1833,Sound very nice perfect for the price
1834,Love it it's number 4!
1835,Wonderful product.  Love alexia
1836,It has a nice speaker.
1837,Music mainly but still checking other features
1838,"Very capable.  Language recognition is the best I've experienced.  Great sound, too!"
1839,LOVE .. LOVE my Echo Plus !  So silly simple to set up .  Alexa has now become my new BFF.  Amazon 24/7 Support is hard to beat !!  Any questions answered any time ... What more can you ask for !!!
1840,Its got to be one of the coolest things.
1841,Awesome! Easy set up. Linked right up with my Nexia home automation.
1842,Hands free voice commands and interactions with smart devices around the house makes having an Echo Plus one of the best purchases I’ve made!
1843,Definitely a really good buy for FIRST time buyers of smart home stuff =]I bought 3 =]
1844,I enjoy the various functions of the device
1845,"Alread had Echos and Dots, but the ability to control Philips Hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on Prime Day.  Another fun product from Amazon."
1846,"I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.  Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!"
1847,Easily configured hub capabilities.  Excellent sound quality for the size of the unit.
1848,Works great in my large open room
1849,Fun
1850,This is outstanding works awesome the music sound very clear and loud and Alexa is very smart
1851,I bought this specifically for the smart hub capability. So far it has been great. Easy set up instructions for all the various brands compatible with it.
1852,"The sound is wonderful and it just plain works. I wish it cost less, but it is worth the cost. (especially on Prime Day)"
1853,Comes with a hub.  Got it during prime day for $99 and a hue white bulb.  Works great.  Now I can add more stuff that required a hub!
1854,"Got it for the smart hub and does exactly was it says, turn lights on and off, arm and disarm my security system and the thermostat is next.  Great.product!"
1855,"Very easy to set up, great sound."
1856,So far it's been very useful. Trying to learn all the ways to use Alexa .
1857,works better than I thought
1858,"Loved all about it, all I can do with it and it looks good."
1859,Great product and fast shipping. Thank you
1860,"It's fun to imagine the household management options ...Some info questions baffle Alexa, but other options are cool - esp. music-related ..."
1861,Easy to set up and works like it's supposed to.
1862,"Love it, very easy to set up.love that you can request just about anything on your mind and it works on giving you useful information."
1863,Great product. More skills are needed. I love it.
1864,My first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.
1865,"This thing is awesome!  I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.  It was still worth the price."
1866,Is great having a new friend
1867,Coop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home
1868,"Easy setup with great sound, I would rate this unit a 10 +++++, and a must have for the office and home. l am looking add other devices (locks, and lights) for my home."
1869,Better than expected!
1870,"Wonderful, still learning how to use. Had a heck of a time setting it up, but is happened somehow."
1871,It's fantastic. Very happy with the purchase.
1872,Love it!!!
1873,I like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.
1874,"It is a great bundle of fun. Music ,games, questions etc. I luv it turns off my smart lights. I purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room!"
1875,First time using Alexa and so far I love it.
1876,"It was a little hard to follow their instructions, great product"
1877,"This was a replacement. It was really easy to set up. I had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub, but installation was easy and instructions were clear."
1878,Really cool device that does a ton of stuff. Fun games like Jeopardy. We used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches. Make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub. Had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges.
1879,"I’ve been waiting for Prime Day to purchase an Echo Plus and now, I’m enjoying learning what Alexa can do. With a new Sonos One and an Echo Dot, I have the makings of a really nice and well-integrated smart home. Love it!"
1880,"I haven't had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions!"
1881,"Although this is my second echo device, I am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found..."
1882,"The Echoplus is a great extension for the Echo Dots in our home. I am a little disappointed that Alexa is not as good at information requests as Google. But as a start on home automation, she is very impressive."
1883,I never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it's mostly YOUTUBE's FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist
1884,Awesome!! Loving Alexa
1885,no habla espanol
1886,Love the music the stories
1887,It is fantastic.
1888,Like it but it will take time to setup all the skills I want simply because there are so many. I already use music and Flash Briefing daily. Very satisfied. I use this along with Alexa app on my Kindle hd8
1889,"Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!"
1890,"Still haven’t learn all the Echo can do, but so far, quite pleased!"
1891,Love it!
1892,I can receive my CPR classical station.  Great sound.What I like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.
1893,"Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t respond or you forget the correct command.  “Alexa, turn on the living room lights”.  Oops I mean “Alexa turn on the family room lights”. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit."
1894,no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it
1895,"I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine."
1896,sounds great have not used the hub yet
1897,"Is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the Amazon App. I also bought the PhilipsHue Light Bulb and all I had to do was put it in my lamp and tell Alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands."
1898,Sound is better
1899,It is as if we are having a conversation with another person.  Instantaneous response.  And the fact that it catches your command even when you're far from it is simply just amazing.
1900,Although I haven't taken advantage of many of the Echo's features there is one that bothers me. It starts talking even when I haven't said anything even close to the wake up word - ECHO - had to change from Alexa due to a conflict with another device.
1901,The echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use.  It plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things.  Still learning what all it can do.  Working very well so far.
1902,We have used for last 2 weeks. We like it. My children also like it. Alexa has become part of our family.
1903,Terrible. Stopped working after one day.
1904,"better sound than my echo dot. Simple to set up, less than 5 minutes."
1905,Nice toy to have around!
1906,"It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I’m not around,,,,,no Spanish!"
1907,Love all the cool thing I can do!
1908,Great product
1909,Like it. Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.
1910,"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities."
1911,Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.
1912,"I love my echo plus. I use it with my Spotify account, to find my phone, make phone calls,  turn our lights off and on, much more. Most importantly it reads story to my children.  They love it and that makes me happy."
1913,Excellent why didn’t I think it is in the beginning I love it
1914,"Bye bye Philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!  Took a little tinkering, had to rest the individual bulbs, but works great! No more, &#34;Philips hue bridge is not responding&#34; message."
1915,"Works great! Exactly as described. Only complaint I have is sometimes Alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff."
1916,I love it. Use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from
1917,Very easy to hook up. Download the app and it walks you through the setup
1918,"I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time."
1919,Well behaved device that i enjoy using.
1920,Easy setup and sound quality.
1921,I really love the hub feature
1922,What a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!
1923,Love this!
1924,"Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices"
1925,Use way more often than we used our Google Home.
1926,"Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result."
1927,"Nice add on to a home.What I don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won't give you much info of sport teams other than American."
1928,"I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I'm no audiophile by any means so maybe it's that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven't had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip's Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I'm glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues."
1929,I love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.
1930,"Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!"
1931,The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed
1932,"The Echo Plus is great! So easy to set up and with the built in hub, it connects to other Alexa devices with a mere verbal command. I am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. Have my lights integrated with Alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. Definitely recommend the Echo Plus!"
1933,Works as advertised! It says Alexa is always learning. That's great because I am just learning all the things Alexa can do.
1934,"Great , love it."
1935,wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.
1936,Doesn't seem to hear as well as my 2nd Generation Echo and WHY is there no volume buttons on it?!
1937,A+
1938,Worked great. The built in hub works great.
1939,It knows everything  we ask it to do. Havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase. Sound quality is excellent also
1940,"Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off."
1941,"It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that's available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful."
1942,I like how easy it was to set up. Very easy to use and set up with other Bluetooth devices.
1943,Ease of use and many tasks it will perform
1944,"I purchased the Echo Plus with built-in hub during Prime Days sale. It was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my WiFi. Also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. I love telling Alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. Excited to learn new uses for it."
1945,"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you."
1946,Nothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.
1947,The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.
1948,The Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.
1949,Arrived right on time and works as expected
1950,It's like a remedial form of the Star Trek computer in your home
1951,The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.
1952,I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights
1953,It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!
1954, 
1955,Awesome!
1956,Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon
1957,"This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can’t wait to see what they come up with next."
1958,Love it. I play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy
1959,I can't get multiple profiles working. It just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt
1960,"I love it , using music and turning on and off light"
1961,It has great sound and very responsive to commands!
1962,This thing is great. Has good sound and does everything I expected. I have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarm.com as well.
1963,No problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great.
1964,"This is a very useful device.  I use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  It works with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.  It also handles all the functions that the other devices can do. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would."
1965,I love my echo plus!!!
1966,"How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.)."
1967,"I have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because I am just not good with electronics.  However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her. Must buy!!!"
1968,"I love my Echo Plus and have cousins from Italy here visiting and they love it.  I want to give them each one, however will it work for them in Italy. someone please answer my question ASAP."
1969,Totally enjoy our new Echo Plus.  Great for fast facts and listening to Beautiful Music.  We are just getting started with all the benefits.
1970,"Device is touted as able to link to calendar on my Samsung phone through google, can't get it to work"
1971,Love this product!!
1972,Music. News. Shopping list. Jokes. Games
1973,Works well. Need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well.
1974,"I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting."
1975, 
1976,The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.
1977,"Still learning what it can do. Amazing. Simple, works right out of a box. Only frustration is getting Amazon Alexa app t show up on my Samsung/Galaxy with Google's Android."
1978,"well what can you say,  Love It  Love It  Love It  enough said"
1979,Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.
1980,"Great product, easy to install and use! Not a necessity but a commodity!"
1981, 
1982,"Works great I bought this Direct from amazon, and I have got to tell you, This item Echo Show and Echo Plus is the best item I have ever had and I am kind of a tech geek. I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again."
1983,"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked."
1984,So far I love it.  It was easy to set up - if I can do it anybody can.  Speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command!
1985,I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.
1986,"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs."
1987, 
1988,I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees
1989,Item as described and delivered on time.  Thank you
1990,I bought 2 of these (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) on Prime Days. Love the Echo Plus easy to setup. The reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works with Amazon Alexa. There is no one to call to find out why.
1991,Product does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective
1992,Exactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!
1993,Easy to install
1994,I have an original Echo and really like it. I wanted another one for my basement. I realize it isn't a huge stereo with settings but it doesn't sound bad at all. Definitely doesn't take up much room. Great price for the Echo Plus on Prime Day. I ordered two!!
1995,"I bought this on prime day and saved lots.I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time. Very impressed with the clarity and volume.You will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio. That’s just a sad fact. It’ll play pandora and Spotify but it’s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptionDoes not stream YouTube music or YouTube audioApple users will be disappointed to see that it’s not as convenient as an apple deviceOverall, I still loved the device but I’ll be getting the DOT which has an audio out jack (as does the echo plus) and just connect to external speakers"
1996,"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already."
1997,Got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event. It sounds pretty good and works well so far.
1998,very nice and its does not take up space
1999,"I'm an original purchaser of the Echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and I've always loved it. I expanded my Alexa usage by adding a few Echo Dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an Echo Plus. Let me tell you what, GREAT choice! As much as I love my original Echo, the Plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound is great. And the fact that it's got a built in hub for the Philips Hue lights is a huge plus!"
2000,received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.
2001,"I’m having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn’t work, the timer doesn’t ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable."
2002,Love it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription
2003,Sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.
2004,"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these."
2005,"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk."
2006,"I love it, in my living room"
2007,Absolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  When playing  music with  Bluetooth speaker outside I have to go inside to change songs.
2008,"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights."
2009,"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem."
2010,"the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;"
2011,"love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time"
2012,"I was suppose to get the “free” lightbulb with purchase. It did not come with Echo. Upon reading more carefully, it says to click a box to receive free bulb. 😳 of course I want the free bulb, who wouldn’t? Just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many “ free”  bulbs away. Disappointed!  I have yet to set up my echo, our first purchase on any alexia device. Debating if we want to keep it. It did come quickly with my prime membership."
2013,I bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should’ve been more clear when i bought it.
2014, 
2015,"Alexa helps with more than just lights or music, it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing  lol  Sweet  love it  so much so I purchased 2, Alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself, when I got it he wasnt so keen on it, but now its his best friend, he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day, as well as sang him Happy birthday  lolol  he now has educated him self on things he never knew, and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked  love it, and to think I was going to hate it."
2016,"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now."
2017,Easy to Install. Very clear speaker. I took one star off because it was delivered late by OnTrac-like usual.
2018,"Love, Love, Love"
2019, 
2020,Good product.
2021,"I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!"
2022,"Pretty cool device. Still have a lot to learn, but I'm changing channels on my Fios, and getting info needed. the speaker is great for what I needed it for, which mainly is music."
2023,"Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon."
2024,Love It
2025,"The sound quality is really quite good. I also have a Dot which is Bluetooth linked to a Grace Digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing Snell speakers, obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much. My only complaint is that you can't customize Alexa hot words. Now that I have multiple Alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an Alexa command to a particular device. I would like to be able to talk to a device by name."
2026,Love the light bulb feature
2027,The Echo Plus works as expected but I never received the Philips Hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase. Please advise.
2028,very nice! everything is working fine. just have to 100% learn the commands
2029,"The sound quality is great, it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen."
2030,Just got mine last night. Played around with it for a while. Should have bought it a long time ago.
2031,"So easy to use, non-stop music!"
2032, 
2033,Great product and Prime Day price! Took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other Echo devices in my home. This came with a Philips smart bulb. It's better than having a clapper! I found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light'. Very easy to set it up with the instructions. You even have an option of what song you want to wake up to!
2034,Exchange new color
2035,Alexa is the best smart speaker out there I'm so glad I came across it the sound is so amazing and I mostly use Amazon Alexa for music and school work help I love to control my room lights and the color totally recommend
2036,It get on sale after 2 days so ... CHECK EVENTS BEFORE U BUY THESE AMAZON PRODUCTS!
2037, 
2038,"Pros- plenty loud for a large room with high ceilings.Cons - the hub doesn’t do anything.  It doesn’t work with z wave (as it states), it doesn’t take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn’t work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper."
2039,"Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed. I'd never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall."
2040,The setup of this device was simple and effective.  I am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of Alexa.  This is great for my mobility issues.  I now have the ability to have my shopping and comfort needs met without depending on friends and family.
2041,Perfect!!!
2042,We love it! Bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily!
2043,Alexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations. Last night I was asking a sibling why they are using Alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs. Then the echo dot downstairs starting singing “oh technology oh technology” kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own.
2044,"Love, Love, Love my Amazon Echo Plus!!❤️❤️"
2045,"The sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. I would recommend to get the Echo Dot and buy a better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos and use the Echo dot."
2046,Alexa was able to call my phone when I couldn’t find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded.  Then I came home a day later and it wouldn’t turn on the light but would shut it off.  Then she said I had no devices; couldn’t find my phone.  Now working again.  We will see.  Love the selection of music!
2047,"I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I’m sure I’m just a small customer to them, but I’ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere"
2048, 
2049,"I love Alexa, she works great but she not for little children. She doesn't understand if you don't speak clearly. She fun to have"
2050,Holy sound quality batman! This thing jams. It's insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around.
2051,Very easy to set up and use. Slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home. Both Alexa and I are learning what we can do.  With each new item I am happier that I made the purchase.  So far my only regret is I didn’t do it sooner.
2052,"Get this in white. I bought it for my girlfriend in white and I wish I had it in white now. Alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when it's not around. I find new uses for Alexa every day. I've Incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life. As Alexa learns more I learn more. She's my alarm clock, she reminds me of important dates. I'm constantly asking her for information like travel, entertainment, science, history, politics Etc. She turns on and off lights, she's the core of my smart home."
2053,I love it best gift I got myself
2054,I love the sound very good. We use it for home automation also works well!!
2055,I really haven’t found any difference between this and the original version I bought. They both work great
2056,Personal
2057,We are really enjoying the echo plus. It is fun too.
2058,"Love Echo, everywhere I go in my house she's always reminding me, playing music or talking to me.  Love her."
2059,Very good quality and you don’t have to yell or be close for it to work and understand you properly
2060,So  convenient ! I will never touch the remote again to shut off my tv!!
2061,We love everything
2062,Easy setup very fun to use. Connects with all my smart home appliances
2063,Expensive but it is a slightly better sound than my Original Echo.
2064,The sound of the speaker is better than the other Echo I own!
2065,"I'm loving my easy access to all the music and books I listen to from Amazon music and audible.  The treble, mid and bass sound well-equalized.  I love that I can easily take it to any area of my house and plug it in.  It's nice and light weight, with a good length of cord."
2066,This is our first Alexa.... we love it!!
2067,"So far using it for lights and music. Will connect my tv, vacuum and doorbell soon. Love it!!!!"
2068,Enjoying it so much!!!
2069,I like that it’s voice activated but it don’t link with any other Bluetooth devices only Alexa devices
2070,It appears to be working fine my first Echo stopped replying to my requests and I received the Echo plus very happy no problems no hassel exchange.
2071,This is the best Amazon speaker with Alexa in it.  But if you’re thinking it’s a good smart hub you’re wrong. Are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell Alexa to Turn them on and off. That’s it! You’re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices.
2072,STILL TRYING TO LINK TO MY SON'S AND DAUGHTER'S IN THEIR ROOMS...
2073, 
2074,Didn’t really work as smooth as they make it seem like.
2075,it does everything that it offers.
2076,LOVE!
2077,"Besides being fun, it also has many practical aspects--a real bonus for those with vision issues!"
2078,Works perfect
2079,Alexa us funny and enjoyable. Nice sound
2080,Echo Plus with built-in Hub - Black ...Amazon
2081,Good product I like it . Thank you !
2082,It's louder than the dot and it's got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house.
2083,Easy set up
2084,"Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it."
2085,WORKS GREAT
2086,Very happy
2087,Love this device
2088,I really like this item. I already had the echo dot but with this purchase the Philips Hue bulb came with the plus. Just purchasing the plus I have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else. I use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and I really like it. The plus is in our great room/kitchen area. So far I give this a 5 star.
2089,Love it!!! Convenient. Responsive. Learns voices within the household. Best assistant so far!
2090,"I am the Training Coordinator at my company and I have used the Amazon Blueprints skill with an Echo device and Echo Buttons to create my own Gameshow/Quiz for new hire orientation training. I'm always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. I believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they're much more likely to remember the information. So far, this has been a huge success with my classes and I look forward to Amazon improving and building out the Blueprints skill further!"
2091,"This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon't fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door."
2092,amazing product with amazing sound!
2093,"I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don't have to worry about putting a CD, in to play. I just command a song and it plays. However; I was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the Echo. After consulting with Amazon and learning that I can purchase a portable Echo charging station I'm good.Sincerely,"
2094,We love this.
2095,"As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over."
2096,We have a great time using this as a family. Even my toddler can talk to her . There are a few features I wish it would learn to do  but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the Google home !
2097,great
2098,"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It’s far from being useful.Half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz"
2099,It is very convenient but wish i could request more music.
2100,Ideal when you have Amazon Prime.. My very first Fire TV Stick... I should have purchased one a long time ago.... I wish I bought 2 or 3 on Amazon Prime Day..... And not to forget the fantastic Alexa features..
2101,We love it! Finally got one for everyone in the home. Most importantly we’re saving money that would have otherwise gone to cable.
2102,I LOVE my Firestick.
2103,I don't know why I held out on getting this for so long.
2104, 
2105,Cord cutting
2106,Works great. Bought as a gift for my boyfriend. Easy & fun to use.
2107, 
2108,It works great
2109,Using it to stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.
2110,I put it on a TV that didn’t have a great picture and it now looks like a new TV
2111,Works as expected
2112,It is much more difficult to use than the Chromecast.
2113,Fast to load. But keeps rebooting  in middle of shows
2114,Great!!
2115,Works great and it's so easy to use that my 4 year old can navigate it.
2116,I live this item.  I bought several for each room in the house and as a gift for my Mom.  I also use mine to travel with.
2117,I love how I can just push the microphone button on the remote and ask it to open any show and it'll find whether it's on Hulu or Netflix and sign me in and start the show... Pretty amazing but each new technology sure is making me lazy or lol :-)
2118,A great product.  I would buy another.
2119,The power cord attachment tends to come loose from the outlet. The adapter may be too long and heavy. Not a big problem but annoying. When the unit is plugged in it works great.
2120,Loved it!! Wish I would have bought one sooner.
2121,Able to watch all of the shows I love and more.
2122,Totally clear picture with numerous channels available. Used for my kitchen tv
2123,Very easy to use.
2124,Easy to use
2125,Love the fire stick. I can download watch great movies. Instead of searching I use Alexa voice.  Prime doesn't offer very many newer movies is the only negative.I also wished there was a way you could set it up to post newest movies first.
2126,Very easy to install. Voice control is great.
2127,Love it!
2128,Great buy at $20!
2129,"I am guilty of not setting this up, I had my youngest daughter do it. She did not seem to have much trouble figuring it out. So I would have to assume it was not very difficult. I have not tried to use it  yet but my oldest seems to like it so she ordered one for herself."
2130,One problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone .. app price 2.99$ .. other than that the device is perfect
2131, 
2132,Streaming is easy.  I love it because I can watch Netflix in my bedroom on my TV and not my Ipad
2133,Absolutely love it
2134,Great product we listen to music all the time
2135,Ummm... TV like everyone else.
2136,We love the Fire TV Stick and will love it even more when we sever our cable connection when our service agreement expires.
2137,Love the TV/movie selection. I really like the fact that I can just rent a movie if they don't have it in their selection.
2138,So far no major issues
2139,I love it! Super easy to use. Hole the button and speak....takes you right to it without delay :-)
2140,Love it...so happy to have everything available through this
2141, 
2142,Best streaming device I've used in 5 years just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the Roku remote does.
2143,Exceeded my expectations
2144,New device so still learning about it but works great for us when navigating Hulu.
2145,Its ok... my home screen on my fire stick is not working on my television. So by that not working...Alexa will not respond to any questions or commands....I'm going to reach out to Amazon this weekend.
2146,So awesome to bring my older tv to life
2147,"This makes a big difference in searching for programs, so much easier then the older fire stick, faster to."
2148,Great and easy to use
2149,"I used to use my laptop for anything show watching, including Netflix, but I am glad I bought this. This is super easy to set up and has everything you need with quick and easy access. Definitely worth the buy."
2150,I just think that it's to darn confusing. And there are parts that i would try and just wouldn't work. I just don't like it. Not what i thought it would be.
2151,"Easy to set up and use,"
2152,I will never buy anything Amazon makes again!This fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly. No warranty from Amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device. I will never buy anything built by Amazon again.
2153,Great buy. Recommend getting Kodi with some movie addons
2154,The firestick is easy to use and was super easy to set up.  I like the platform and feel it is better than I expected.  I was worried about it lagging but it has not at all.  I’m hoping to utilize the firestick to eventually break away from cable and now I’m more confident that it can happen.
2155,Works much easier than our 3 year old one. Better internet resemption
2156,Works amazing! I love how you can download almost anything. Some apps I couldn’t download on my Apple TV but I was able too on here!!!
2157,"The Fire TV Stick was easy to set up and use. Only downfall is, subscriptions are needed to view premium content."
2158,Prime video
2159,Love it! It's everything I wanted and more
2160,"I like the way you can watch anything and everything , for some live shows you need a cable provider"
2161,Es  excelente funciona genial
2162,Was loving it but starting in June Hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn’t work either. Probably will switch to something else soon.
2163,Puts the pep back in my old TV.  All of the software was expired and I enjoy NETFLIX and Amazon Prime Video.  Now I have all of my favorite Video on the TV again......
2164,Haven't used it enough
2165,The Fire Stick has been amazing! Easy  setup and easy to use! An awesome deal on Prime Day!
2166,Love the fire stick and the amazon customer service!!!
2167,Easy to use and setup.
2168,Great streaming device
2169,"Works as expected, very easy to setup and use"
2170,Awesome product!
2171,"The selection is wonderful and the ease of use on the home page is nice. I wish, however, it didn't keep overcoming my settings for my other devices attached to my TV.  I have to keep switching back after any switches in programming, including my stereo."
2172,Bought the 2nd firestick for bedroom. Easily installed and set up. Works great
2173,Great interface.  i enjoy the voice remote
2174,I liked it was linked to prime
2175,It good
2176,I love it
2177,I already bought one previously to try out and enjoyed it.  Bought these new ones during the Prime sale.
2178,Works like a charm. Fast delivery and no problems.
2179,ok
2180,I loved it so much on my living room TV that I bought one for the bedroom TV. Highly recommend this device to anyone wanting to simplify and improve their online entertainment experience.
2181,Does everything I need!
2182,Love it love it love it
2183,awesome device
2184,CAN WATCH AMAZON PRIME SHOWS AND TALK TO ALEXUS
2185,"This product replaces the 1st generation Fire Stick I had, and what an improvement in speed in both showing Amazon content but ALL apps downloaded on PRODUCT! I bought in on PRIME day for $19 .... BEST DEAL EVER !"
2186,"Just as advertised, bought as a gift, great price, fast shipping!!"
2187, 
2188,Very easy to set up and straight forward directions. Loads fast also.
2189,I purchased the Fire Stick to be able to watch movies at my convenience. I love that there is such a variety of genres. I also enjoy it gives you the ability to watch TV shows too. It's Awesome!
2190,Being able to tell it what to go to
2191,Love this! So many options!
2192,I love it
2193,Love it. Many stations to choose from
2194,It was a gift.
2195,"It still doesn’t work.  I bet if I call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time.  Ridiculous."
2196,I love the Alexa remote and easy to use.
2197, 
2198,works great
2199,"It is very easy to use,I can now watch my favorite movies"
2200,"Doubtful at first, but it works a lot better than my smart devices.Plus Alexa software include, that was a plus!"
2201,"Love our Fire Stick,easy to set up and have loads of shows for free and plenty to rent or buy.We also use Pluto TV and Tubi so that's even more TV.Alexa makes it so easy to find any show or movie I want.We love the money we save."
2202,It was perfect.  Works like a charm.
2203,Netflix and Hulu
2204,"I love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps, I discovered that a lot of the channels I don't have with my cable provider is included,  and I don't have to pay extra! Just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and I still come out paying way less than cable tv."
2205,Love this wished I had gotten it sooner
2206,Makes accessing all of the Apps easy. Love the voice control.
2207,It's my second one and works well
2208,I love my fire stick!
2209,Great product. Very versatile and easy to use
2210,Ease of usage
2211,"I love this, it's quick and easy to use. I love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use. I also love the music app on here. I didn't think I would use it because I have Alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there. But I tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play! Love it!!"
2212,Love it. The only downside is that you can't download any app you want.
2213,Still learning how to use it but like it so far. We played music from YouTube and a couple movies on it. No complaints
2214,We are using the internet for our home and loving them
2215,My Father liked the added programing in which he is interested.
2216,I love my fire stick
2217,Love it and how easy it is to use. One of the best Prime Day purchases we have made.
2218,Satisfied with the purchase
2219,Im able to connect to prime quick
2220,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO EASY TO USE BETTER THAN SCROLLING CHANNELS.
2221, 
2222,Loved it. No more cable bills for us.  I would advise anyone to get one. 2nd one bought.
2223,I bought it for my sister and she hasn't had any complaints yet so I think it's great!
2224,"absolutely an amazing device, very easy to setup and use"
2225,"The current demand for this stick, was too high for the power coming out of my USB port on the TV. Had to run the power cable to the supplied USB adapter. Not a big deal but added another cable showing on my wall mounted TV."
2226,Works very well for Amazon and Netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like VUDU. It also will shut down if HULU is played for more than a couple minutes and yes I have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue (even checked outlet voltage) an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue.over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use If they would fix those two issues I would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one. to bad to because I relay like amazon products and having Alexa is always nice
2227,Love the Firestick thinking about canceling the satellite
2228,"I'm amazed at how many movies, tv shows and more is available. I am planning to drop cable service soon and am very happy to know I'll have lots of viewing pleasure with the Fire stick and not pay the outrageous cable bills."
2229,Easy to setup.  Sometimes Alexis does not work the greatest. The connection fire stick and WiFi is way bettter than Netflix .
2230,Works great
2231,Ease of use.
2232,Finally bought one but it couldn't find my Wi-Fi. Had to buy a Wi-Fi extended. My smart t.v. used the Wi-Fi just fine.
2233,This firestick is everything!
2234,"Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed."
2235,Everything
2236,Love this!
2237,Really enjoying my firestick can’t wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.
2238,Good
2239,Love it!
2240,Easy to set up and use.
2241,WooHoo! $20 on Prime Day; done!
2242,Perfect
2243,Very easy to use! Makes finding shows and movies a snap.
2244, 
2245,Upgraded from a first generation firestick. I don't know why I waited so long. I love it!
2246,Amazing device
2247,Great product.
2248,"This was a replacement of an older version of Fire Stick. I haven't tried the Alexa voice part of this remote yet, but it works great."
2249,I bought and love them. Alexa is very convenient.
2250,Like
2251,"I don't have Alexa, but after getting this I'm feeling inspired to get one. I feel this is a good gateway and or Alexa trial, and liking it so far.  Channels work just fine like Apple TV, just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing, because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching YouTube clips"
2252,I definitely like this product.  Wanted to be able to watch Netflix on my tv!  Easy to install!
2253,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2254,Great product. So many features.
2255,"I like to watch older shows, 70's and 80's, and the firestick gives me the opportunity to find those shows."
2256,I really like this product and the fact that I can get apps that I am unable to get on my smart tv
2257,Works wonderfully.
2258,Use it all the time and love it. Very quality product.
2259,I have used Roku & Mi Tv box. This fire TV stick is very similar. Easy to use.
2260,We all just love the TV fire stick and I would buy it again.
2261,Is good.
2262,Works really well.
2263,Worked as advertised !
2264,It works great. Better than the previous fire stick!
2265,"Very easy setup, and Alexa can be heard well and receive Very well."
2266,I like my Amazon Fire stick I use it for my TV thank you for your help when I called you to get further instructions how to use it thank you have a good evening
2267,Great ! It was the best decision ! Especially if you have Amazon Prime.
2268,I love everything about the fire stick. It’s easy to use and Alexa makes it quicker to get to tv shows or music.
2269,Works great! Alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for!
2270,I was able to use this in another room and add Alexa in that room.
2271,"Works great, speed is fast. Exactly what we needed"
2272,This was just an additional one for my other TV. Loved it so much use it on the regular TV. Easy to set up and fairly easy to navigate. I don’t waste my money on regular TV cable or anything else. This is enough for me as I don’t watch too much TV.
2273,I love this! It’s user friendly and better than any streaming device we have previously used. I wish we had purchased sooner and purchased more of them.
2274,"My 90 year old Mom LOVES that she can watch the 1st Season of Blue Bloods ❤. My one wish is that she could watch CSI:MIAMI...without having to pay for it...😥 The bill for OPTIMUM is already, quite high. Can you help us? We live on Long Island, NY (Suffolk County )"
2275,Excellent
2276,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!  It’s just what l needed and MORE!!!  I didn’t realize that the remote included voice remote.  HOW CONVENIENT!!!!  I’m so glad that l made that purchase!!!!
2277,"It’s better than I thought, it practically turns your regular tv into a smart tv!"
2278,"Lovee it! It has evrything I need it, now I cant even get my dad out of my room hahahaha... movie addicts."
2279,Works great to watch youtube and amazin video
2280,"Like it alots, something different than traditional television. The use of Alexa is nice too."
2281,Works well I have several of these recommend to anyone
2282,"Awesome, wish I had gotten one sooner."
2283,Great product
2284,Works great no lag and is much better than the gen 1 devices I was using. I would recommend this if you have a 1rst gen and are tired of the lag and crashes.
2285,Works great. Easy set up.
2286,Love it so easy to use
2287,I love the firestick ! It's easy to set up and use. It rarely stops to buffer and. It  would be a bargain at twice the price.
2288,"I do like the Fire Stick and I’m very close to cutting the cable.  I can find many movies and shows, while keeping my budget in check.  I’m learning how to maneuver around the channels and find my shows quickly."
2289,Simple install and love the voice activation
2290,We haven’t used it much yet.  We like what we have used. My husband loves it.
2291,very easy to set up and very easy to use

2298,This thing is awesome. We watch it more then the regular cable. Going to by more on Black Friday as Christmas gifts.
2299,Love all the options with the fire tv stick!Works great!
2300,The menu''s are cumbersome to get your apps set up.
2301,Easy to use
2302,Awesome
2303,Good shape
2304,"I’m very unhappy with this Firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. We have 2 Roku’s That work just fine and are very quick."
2305,"Had to return it as Hulu does not work on device.  It kept coming up with errors, and Hulu app not being able to open at times.  It was hit and miss, and at times, Hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie.  Plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps."
2306,I love my amazon sticks
2307,I like being able to watch pretty much anything I want at anytime. Works great!
2308,I love my fire stick. It is so easy to use.
2309,The Firestick we were sent doesn’t work. At all.  Voice remote won’t even turn on. We did all the troubleshooting steps. Didn’t work. Contacted Amazon. They sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! We gave up and got a Roku (which works great!)
2310,Just the perfect cost effective solution.  Thank you Amazon.
2311,Firestick easy to use and I enjoyed it.
2312,i do wish the dot could connect to the fire stick but both products still worked flawlessly
2313,"My old amazon fire stick kept crashing when using Sling TV.I bought this one thinking the old one was defective.This one is doing the same thing. When going back into Sling, it starts up where I left off in the program."
2314,Ordered 2 on deal day. 1 doesn’t work and 2 nd just went down after 2 days 😏
2315,"Love my fire stick and remote, so easy to set up and use. Endless amounts of apps to download! Used it with my smart tv and it’s 100X better than the features smart TVs offer"
2316,Great easy to set up.A little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent
2317,Super good!
2318,Fun taking to the TV. Works good. It’s a little confusing moving around the programs.
2319,That it doesn’t turn my television on or off.
2320,"I loved how easy this was to install sry up, and use! Simply amazing.  So amazing we bought two!This allowed us to officially ""CUT THE CABLE CORD"".Love it!"
2321,I expected to have access to more current movie instead of having to pay. The easy setup was helpful and I love the speedy delivery.
2322,"Works great! I recommend it to anyone who has prime, WiFi and an hdm1 tv. That’s all u need. I’m not really technologically savvy but even I was able to set it up with included and on screen directions."
2323,need a few more
2324,I love that you can watch Bob Dylan’s movies
2325,Love the Alexa feature. Firestick is working just fine.
2326,Very easy to install.  Very intuitive to use.  Very happy with the purchase.
2327,Ease of use!
2328,"I don't like how I cannot load my Hulu account, it is also very slow. I know it is not my Internet connection because I have an Xbox One that works just fine, but my Fire TV Stick takes forever to load anything."
2329,Amazing for all your entertainment needs!
2330,"It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch anything without interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from."
2331,"I didn’t realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick. I thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you Singley plugged into your tv. However, since using my amazon fire stick I have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all."
2332,I love it!!!!!!
2333,Easy to install and operate. Works with Alexa voice commands.
2334,"This was a Prime Day purchase. I'm still learning my way around it. So far, so good. The addition of Alexa is nice."
2335,I love how it is Alexa enabled. I just say the show I want to watch and &#34;she&#34; knows how and where to find it for me!
2336,Super easy to set up.  Easy to use. Lots of app options available.
2337,"The first stick is a solid, entry level, device and does what it's supposed to do."
2338,"Works fine, I wanted this for my bedroom television."
2339,Does not work with you tube tv
2340,Easy to set up; Easy to use!
2341,I love all the viewing choices on FIRE STICK!
2342,Good product
2343,This is my 2nd fire TV stick with Alexa I have been very happy with my first one love that you can use so many apps with it. Big 👍
2344,"Love the Firestick! My kids love that they can talk to Alexa and get the weather, local news, etc."
2345,It offers hours of entertainment and it was very easy to install and activate 👍
2346,amazon fire stick is amazing !!!
2347,I have 2 of them the one I have to reset it at least once a week or so some times twice
2348,Awesome product more than expected
2349,I don’t like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of “inactivity”. I shouldn’t have to “wake up” the fire tv to finish watching a show.
2350,availability of movies and nothing I don't like
2351,"Very satisfied, easy setup. Great product. Highly recommend."
2352,We like it better than Roku.  Voice commands really work.
2353,"Easy setup, works flawlessly!"
2354,Easy to hook up.  Wish I knew all its capabilities
2355,Great Purchase
2356,Easy to set up
2357,It was easy to use for our bedroom TV.
2358,"I used Chromecast before this, it was okay. But I love the FireStick. Works great, doesn’t lag. Would recommend!"

2360,I bought this fire stick for another TV! No more arguments about what to watch!
2361,"I liked it until on day after a year it no longer worked, would not power up  and go past the firestick  logo on tv. Bought a second one, will not buy a third if this one doesn't last longer...."
2362,We love our fire stick!! The Alexa voice control is fantastic for my younger kids!!
2363,Setup was easy and usage was intuitive.  I've used it away from home and it works great.
2364,I really love that all my apps are in one spot
2365,I love the number of movies that are available using this device. Took me a little time to setup and learn how to work it. The only thing I miss is local channels.
2366,Love that the fire stick allows me enough choices to ditch cable!
2367,Plenty of options to choose from!
2368,It worked as a charmed.
2369,I love it . Easy set up as well
2370,I love how fast you get a respond from Alexa.Also easy to find any thing you are looking forjust speak in to the remote.
2371,Extremely easy to use! Switched away from directv and use it to stream T.V.
2372,It don’t show nothing
2373,Works like a charm!
2374,"Works great, some of the apps will start buffering but it’s probably my internet. Love the Alexa voice control."
2375,"It does what it says it will do.  The picture quality is better than what I have been receiving on cable TV.  Only downside is if you pause the movie for more than a couple minutes it takes a long time to come back on and you often get a message that your internet speed is too slow (I'm clocking 300 mb at my house on a good day).  Also, voice command through Alexia doesn't work well, but that could be operator error.  All in all, for $20 you can't beat it."
2376,I loved everything
2377,"Very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload, we had lost our local Charlotte NC channels (which are pur news and weather also)  (CBS, NBC, ABC) and 2 days later was Amazon day with discounts on what we had JUST ordered."
2378,Second one for my house. This is great...I am not tech oriented and all I have to do is hold down a button and talk. Now I am watching tv too much! LOL!
2379,"I love this thing! The Alexa feature makes it so easy to find what you want no matter which streaming service has it.  No more searching Netflix then Amazon etc to see if either has your show,  Alexa finds it for you!"
2380,Great product
2381,Love it!
2382,I feel that the voice feature is useless. Lots of channels to stream though.
2383,Garbage...Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show. The cheapest Roku works 100 time better. DO not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.
2384,Loved it.
2385,Love the fire stick. Alexa works well on it too. Would recommend.
2386,"Just getting started with the Fire TV Stick. So far, so good."
2387,"Easy to set up, lots of things to watch and program in.  Have not even gotten that far into it yet.  Easy to use. Highly recommended.  Leaning more and more closer to cutting the cable cord for good."
2388,Was a gift
2389,"This is my second Firestick, I a very pleased with the ease of use."
2390,I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.
2391,Worth every cent.
2392,I like when thete nothing to watch on tv I can run to my firestick.
2393,Access to apps
2394,Easy to install and use.
2395,Thank you! Great Product!
2396,Purchased this for the Man cave and loving it.
2397,las películas no tiene o no se pueden cambiar a español o títulos en español
2398,Easy to install. Up and running in minutes.
2399,Was excited to try this on my new Element TV.  Unfortunately even though my TV is 5 feet away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering.  Thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue.  It didn’t!
2400,"Easy to use, all your favorite programs. All inclusive, nothing else to buy."
2401,Fun to play with
2402,"as of now,i love everything about it"
2403,Powerful little stick
2404,"Superb is all we can say.  Plugged the unit in, set up the HDMI and boom, we were watching better TV.  Thank you."
2405,It's like having your tv as a big tablet
2406,Loved them
2407,I am very pleased with the Fire Stick.
2408,"works good, ni issues"
2409,great price great product fire stick is the best i think works better then roku.
2410,Love how I can take it on vacation and use it. Very easy to set up.
2411,"As a user of Chromecast for years I have to say that the Firestick is a nice upgrade. I really like that I can download all the apps for different media sources like HBO, Showtime, etc. that I have free access to from my cable account but with the Firestick I get a better picture and can go directly to the shows I want to see. The downside was the time it took to download all the apps and set them up, but the good thing is that the setup is a onetime procedure."
2412,Currently own 3 Chromecast devices and tge Fire Stick is superior to them.  We are so pleased that we can watch programs on Netflix and Prime without a smart phone or computer.  Very easy to install and use!
2413,Menu doesn’t work. Says it can’t connect to amazon network
2414,I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.
2415,"This was purchased for our toy hauler, but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane.  It was wonderful to plug into our hotel TV and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials."
2416,"Already had a firestick in our livingroom, great entertainment, had to get one for the bedroom."
2417,very good option
2418,Purchased to use on the road in my semi. Does not work in that application.
2419,Great
2420,I love my fire stick thank you so much
2421,Easy to set-up!  I am enjoying the added video choices for my television.
2422,"The installation and connection to my Wi-Fi was so easy! Getting the Amazon Prime and Netflix going was a breeze. I have not used a voice remote before. That was amazing (yes, I am old school). I will be reviewing more features and options as I have time, but I am very excited to own such a product that lives up to the all the great things I have read and heard."
2423,"I like this product. However, the set up was a bit difficult. I had to reset it to the factory setting abd start from scratch."
2424,I loved the I can use voice to make a request. I use it for music and movies.
2425,Very easy to install and am excited to use!
2426,"so far, so good, works great."
2427,"Great device, I'm cutting my cable and watching the channels I want. If I want to add an app like CBS I can just pay a little extra and get it."
2428,"Everything about it is great, love the Alexa voice remote"
2429,Works like a charm...
2430, 
2431,Thought it was pretty cool new to streaming thing seemed easy to use
2432,"Super-Easy setup, only issue i find is that it occasionally loses connection with household network."
2433,Turned our old TV into a smart TV. Really easy interface. Have bought 4 now.
2434,"Easy set up, works perfect."
2435,This is an awesome product. I wanted to test out the differences between this and my Roku and both are very nice. I will likely be using this for traveling as well.
2436,😄😄
2437,Good wifi TV stick
2438,I love it
2439,"Seems to work ok, but no youtube tv?  Really?  can't believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use.  I really wanted to like it, but when I couldn't install that particular app it became almost useless, almost.  Does most other stuff just fine, but I'll stick with my Roku."
2440,This thing is great if you have internet and amazon prime.
2441,Awesome product
2442,"Easy set up, nice looking interface and I like the new slightly larger remote. I have a 1st Gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time. And great price!"
2443,Great product and easy to use
2444,"Great gadget that installs, and works easily. Nice to not have another box taking up space too!"
2445,Excellent product and service.  Very easy to install and my daughter is very happy.
2446,Great entertainment
2447,Being able to use it with my Alexa Echo was great!
2448,Easy to use and fast setup
2449,LOVE IT!!!!!
2450,"I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!"
2451,Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive
2452,beyond awesome
2453,I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.
2454,Family loved it!
2455, 
2456,I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.
2457,Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.
2458,"Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend"
2459,"Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program"
2460,Great
2461,"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!"
2462,Love this thing works great and kids love it to
2463,Love it.. makes the simple things in life simpler
2464,"I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books"
2465,Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.
2466,"Alarm and music, information the weather"
2467,Love it! Very helpful
2468,Good but it’s pretty low
2469,"Alarm, calendar, reminders"
2470,"I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office."
2471,I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND IS SO AMAZING AND GREAT
2472,Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.
2473,The speaker could be better...
2474,I love it!!
2475,3rd Dot. Love it!
2476,works like any other one!
2477,Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.
2478,I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!
2479,I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!
2480,Nice product
2481,Love my echo. Love playing music in my room
2482,"Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!"
2483,Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn’t know. I thought she was supposed to know everything
2484,my new best friend :)
2485,Absolutely love it!!!!
2486,I liked linking two more rooms in the home
2487,I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!
2488,"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device."
2489,Small size works great in our sunroom.
2490,I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.
2491,"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."
2492,"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work"
2493,"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa"
2494,"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home."
2495,Great product at a great price.
2496,My son loves his Echo Dot.
2497,Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.
2498,I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.
2499,It plays music that I request.
2500,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.
2501,Luv it.  It's a great product.
2502,"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled."
2503,Great product
2504,"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely."
2505,"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam."
2506,"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol"
2507,"Alarm,bed time story, universal"
2508,I am in love with alexa
2509,Its was easy to set up
2510, 
2511,Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.
2512,Great product
2513,Really like it
2514,I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.
2515,The volume is very low
2516,so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity
2517,"My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!"
2518,Wish volume was capable of going louder
2519,I love it
2520,Best purchase this year.
2521,"I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots."
2522,I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%
2523,its okay but keeps dropping wifi!
2524,Kids love it! I love it!
2525, 
2526,Love my echo dot easy to use and set up
2527,love it as I do all of my echos
2528,Excellent product !!
2529,"I love being able to control lights, doors and music."
2530,Fun To interact with
2531,Very satisfied with the product
2532,"We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!"
2533,"I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too."
2534,Like having the music where ever I am.
2535,"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker."
2536,"No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker."
2537,I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon
2538,Great to have along with the Echo
2539,this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.
2540,"daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet."
2541,Cheap and cheap sound.
2542,This is pretty cool
2543,"Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!"
2544,Love it!! Don’t know what took me so long to get one — and don’t know why I didn’t get two on Amazon Prime Day!
2545,Up dated news
2546,Works like a champ.
2547,"Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need."
2548,Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.
2549,love it...just like the other 4 I own.
2550,"Great price.  I love my echo dot,"
2551,Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!
2552,works great
2553,Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha
2554,"Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!"
2555,Just got my third one. Love them
2556,The ease in installing
2557,"Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet."
2558,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”."
2559,"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item."
2560,Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!
2561,"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs."
2562,"Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room."
2563,It does everything  the big guy does
2564,Great product - understands my accent!
2565,Love it... can't stop using it..
2566,Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.
2567, 
2568,"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps."
2569,Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!
2570,It is s great tool helping with information.
2571,Used twice not working!!!!!!!
2572,Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.
2573,"I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out."
2574,Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.
2575,"Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too"
2576,Work pretty well
2577,Still learning it
2578,"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of."
2579,Usual reliable Alexa
2580,Speaker could be better qualty
2581,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!
2582,Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great
2583,"Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one."
2584,Very pleased
2585,Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.
2586,Nice
2587,"Music, weather, time."
2588,"Great, love it!"
2589,Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better
2590,Not impressed
2591,I really like it .
2592,it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!
2593,Alexa is phenomenal!
2594,"When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock."
2595,"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing."
2596,I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.
2597,I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.
2598,"Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such."
2599,"Great product, fun to use!!"
2600,Needs to be smarter
2601,I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...
2602,Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome
2603,I really like the echo dot. It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.
2604,Convenient and fun.
2605,It's alright....
2606,this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!
2607,"I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends."
2608,Second dot.
2609,Son loves it.
2610,I love how compact it is.
2611,"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace."
2612,"It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to."
2613,Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.
2614,"Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun."
2615,Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!
2616,I love it! I use it for everything. It’s a part of my daily routine
2617,"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder."
2618,Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.
2619,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.
2620,Set up is so easy.
2621,Love it
2622,I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.
2623,I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.
2624,"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!"
2625,"I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!"
2626,I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????
2627, 
2628, 
2629,Gave as a gift - they loved it.
2630,The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.
2631,I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier
2632,"I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account."
2633,Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!
2634,"Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,"
2635,Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.
2636,I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.
2637,"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone."
2638,It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.
2639,Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play
2640,Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.
2641,love it
2642,Works like a charm.
2643,Good speaker for bedroom or office
2644,Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.
2645,Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!
2646,It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!
2647,I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.
2648,Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.
2649,"The sound quality wasn’t great, but it was inexpensive"
2650,Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.
2651,It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.
2652,It’s great but sound quality is very low
2653,I love it.
2654,"As Always, easy to set up"
2655,It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.
2656,"Very intelligent, love the songs ...."
2657,Review
2658,"I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money."
2659,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.
2660,Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.
2661,"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill."
2662, 
2663,The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.
2664,HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND
2665,I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.
2666,"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed."
2667,Totally gets out sense of humour
2668,We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.
2669,"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!"
2670,LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.
2671,Better sound.
2672,"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound."
2673,"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device."
2674,"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!"
2675,"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now."
2676,"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions."
2677,Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker
2678,Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.
2679,small footprint.  nice clarity.
2680,Easy set up
2681,"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value"
2682,I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.
2683,I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.
2684,this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.
2685,Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.
2686,"A great product for the price, works well!!"
2687,Perfect for a home office
2688,Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.
2689,It does what it's suppose to do great product.
2690,I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.
2691,Love the dot
2692,Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.
2693,"I'm still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus."
2694,Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.
2695,"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have."
2696,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.
2697,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(
2698,"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!"
2699,Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.
2700,Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time
2701,Love it!
2702,I'm addicted to this thing.
2703,I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.
2704,So far all.i can say is I love it
2705,"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora."
2706,Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home
2707,"I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????"
2708,Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.
2709,"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do"
2710,We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!
2711,"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done."
2712,"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price."
2713,Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!
2714,It works just like my other Dots.
2715,Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.
2716,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.
2717,I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.
2718,"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder."
2719,"Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it."
2720,Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.
2721,I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices
2722,Works great!
2723,I like almost everything
2724,"AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine."
2725,"My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions"
2726,Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.
2727,Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom
2728,Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house
2729,Works great and easy to set up!
2730,My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.
2731,Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.
2732, 
2733,Love our little dot. I don’t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.
2734,Really like it
2735,"Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it."
2736,Love it
2737,Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.
2738,Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!
2739,as expected
2740,I didn’t order it
2741,"I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room."
2742,Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.
2743,Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do
2744,"Does what I expected, and more."
2745,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.
2746,I have a friend now.
2747,It’s easier to do things with it
2748,Good device
2749,"Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or ""Alexa"" becoming accustom to what is being asked."
2750,"these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs."
2751,"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices."
2752,"I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I'm addicted!"
2753,"Works beautifully, excellent sound."
2754,Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker
2755,neat tool we enjoy it with the family
2756,Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.
2757,"I live alone, this is the best companion!"
2758,Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!
2759,"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!"
2760,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.
2761,This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*
2762,I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself
2763, 
2764,It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.
2765,I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.
2766,Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom
2767,"excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns"
2768,It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.
2769, 
2770,I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.
2771,I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.
2772, 
2773,"Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music."
2774,This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.
2775, 
2776,works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.
2777,Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great
2778,We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.
2779,Use the product for music and it’s great!
2780,Easy to set-up and to use.
2781,It works great!!
2782,I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.
2783,PHENOMENAL
2784,I loved it does exactly what it says
2785,I used it to control my smart home devices. Works great.
2786,Very convenient
2787,"Este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor, perdió toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol"
2788,Easy to set up Ready to use in minutes.
2789,Barry
2790, 
2791,My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.
2792,Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.
2793,love it
2794,"Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!"
2795,"Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up."
2796,"I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems."
2797,"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers."
2798,Good
2799,Nice little unit  no issues
2800,"The echo dot was easy to set up and use. It helps provide music, etc. to small spaces and was just what I was looking for."
2801,"I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!"
2802,Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive
2803,beyond awesome
2804,I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.
2805,Family loved it!
2806, 
2807,I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.
2808,Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.
2809,"Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend"
2810,"Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program"
2811,Great
2812,"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!"
2813,Love this thing works great and kids love it to
2814,Love it.. makes the simple things in life simpler
2815,"I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books"
2816,Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.
2817,"Alarm and music, information the weather"
2818,Love it! Very helpful
2819,Good but it’s pretty low
2820,"Alarm, calendar, reminders"
2821,"I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office."
2822,I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND IS SO AMAZING AND GREAT
2823,Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.
2824,The speaker could be better...
2825,I love it!!
2826,3rd Dot. Love it!
2827,works like any other one!
2828,Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.
2829,I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!
2830,I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!
2831,Nice product
2832,Love my echo. Love playing music in my room
2833,"Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!"
2834,Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn’t know. I thought she was supposed to know everything
2835,my new best friend :)
2836,Absolutely love it!!!!
2837,I liked linking two more rooms in the home
2838,I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!
2839,"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device."
2840,Small size works great in our sunroom.
2841,I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.
2842,"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."
2843,"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work"
2844,"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa"
2845,"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home."
2846,Great product at a great price.
2847,My son loves his Echo Dot.
2848,Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.
2849,I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.
2850,It plays music that I request.
2851,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.
2852,Luv it.  It's a great product.
2853,"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled."
2854,Great product
2855,"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely."
2856,"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam."
2857,"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol"
2858,"Alarm,bed time story, universal"
2859,I am in love with alexa
2860,Its was easy to set up
2861, 
2862,Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.
2863,Great product
2864,Really like it
2865,I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.
2866,The volume is very low
2867,so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity
2868,"My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!"
2869,Wish volume was capable of going louder
2870,I love it
2871,Best purchase this year.
2872,"I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots."
2873,I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%
2874,its okay but keeps dropping wifi!
2875,Kids love it! I love it!
2876, 
2877,Love my echo dot easy to use and set up
2878,love it as I do all of my echos
2879,Excellent product !!
2880,"I love being able to control lights, doors and music."
2881,Fun To interact with
2882,Very satisfied with the product
2883,"We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!"
2884,"I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too."
2885,Like having the music where ever I am.
2886,"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker."
2887,"No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker."
2888,I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon
2889,Great to have along with the Echo
2890,this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.
2891,"daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet."
2892,Cheap and cheap sound.
2893,This is pretty cool
2894,"Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!"
2895,Love it!! Don’t know what took me so long to get one — and don’t know why I didn’t get two on Amazon Prime Day!
2896,Up dated news
2897,Works like a champ.
2898,"Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need."
2899,Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.
2900,love it...just like the other 4 I own.
2901,"Great price.  I love my echo dot,"
2902,Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!
2903,works great
2904,Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha
2905,"Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!"
2906,Just got my third one. Love them
2907,The ease in installing
2908,"Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet."
2909,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”."
2910,"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item."
2911,Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!
2912,"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs."
2913,"Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room."
2914,It does everything  the big guy does
2915,Great product - understands my accent!
2916,Love it... can't stop using it..
2917,Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.
2918, 
2919,"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps."
2920,Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!
2921,It is s great tool helping with information.
2922,Used twice not working!!!!!!!
2923,Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.
2924,"I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out."
2925,Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.
2926,"Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too"
2927,Work pretty well
2928,Still learning it
2929,"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of."
2930,Usual reliable Alexa
2931,Speaker could be better qualty
2932,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!
2933,Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great
2934,"Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one."
2935,Very pleased
2936,Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.
2937,Nice
2938,"Music, weather, time."
2939,"Great, love it!"
2940,Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better
2941,Not impressed
2942,I really like it .
2943,it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!
2944,Alexa is phenomenal!
2945,"When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock."
2946,"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing."
2947,I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.
2948,I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.
2949,"Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such."
2950,"Great product, fun to use!!"
2951,Needs to be smarter
2952,I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...
2953,Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome
2954,I really like the echo dot. It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.
2955,Convenient and fun.
2956,It's alright....
2957,this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!
2958,"I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends."
2959,Second dot.
2960,Son loves it.
2961,I love how compact it is.
2962,"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace."
2963,"It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to."
2964,Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.
2965,"Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun."
2966,Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!
2967,I love it! I use it for everything. It’s a part of my daily routine
2968,"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder."
2969,Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.
2970,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.
2971,Set up is so easy.
2972,Love it
2973,I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.
2974,I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.
2975,"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!"
2976,"I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!"
2977,I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????
2978, 
2979, 
2980,Gave as a gift - they loved it.
2981,The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.
2982,I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier
2983,"I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account."
2984,Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!
2985,"Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,"
2986,Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.
2987,I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.
2988,"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone."
2989,It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.
2990,Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play
2991,Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.
2992,love it
2993,Works like a charm.
2994,Good speaker for bedroom or office
2995,Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.
2996,Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!
2997,It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!
2998,I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.
2999,Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.
3000,"The sound quality wasn’t great, but it was inexpensive"
3001,Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.
3002,It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.
3003,It’s great but sound quality is very low
3004,I love it.
3005,"As Always, easy to set up"
3006,It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.
3007,"Very intelligent, love the songs ...."
3008,Review
3009,"I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money."
3010,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.
3011,Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.
3012,"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill."
3013, 
3014,The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.
3015,HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND
3016,I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.
3017,"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed."
3018,Totally gets out sense of humour
3019,We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.
3020,"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!"
3021,LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.
3022,Better sound.
3023,"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound."
3024,"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device."
3025,"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!"
3026,"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now."
3027,"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions."
3028,Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker
3029,Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.
3030,small footprint.  nice clarity.
3031,Easy set up
3032,"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value"
3033,I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.
3034,I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.
3035,this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.
3036,Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.
3037,"A great product for the price, works well!!"
3038,Perfect for a home office
3039,Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.
3040,It does what it's suppose to do great product.
3041,I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.
3042,Love the dot
3043,Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.
3044,"I'm still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus."
3045,Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.
3046,"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have."
3047,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.
3048,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(
3049,"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!"
3050,Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.
3051,Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time
3052,Love it!
3053,I'm addicted to this thing.
3054,I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.
3055,So far all.i can say is I love it
3056,"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora."
3057,Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home
3058,"I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????"
3059,Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.
3060,"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do"
3061,We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!
3062,"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done."
3063,"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price."
3064,Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!
3065,It works just like my other Dots.
3066,Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.
3067,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.
3068,I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.
3069,"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder."
3070,"Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it."
3071,Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.
3072,I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices
3073,Works great!
3074,I like almost everything
3075,"AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine."
3076,"My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions"
3077,Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.
3078,Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom
3079,Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house
3080,Works great and easy to set up!
3081,My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.
3082,Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.
3083, 
3084,Love our little dot. I don’t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.
3085,Really like it
3086,"Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it."
3087,Love it
3088,Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.
3089,Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!
3090,as expected
3091,I didn’t order it
3092,"I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room."
3093,Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.
3094,Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do
3095,"Does what I expected, and more."
3096,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.
3097,I have a friend now.
3098,It’s easier to do things with it
3099,Good device
3100,"Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or ""Alexa"" becoming accustom to what is being asked."
3101,"these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs."
3102,"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices."
3103,"I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I'm addicted!"
3104,"Works beautifully, excellent sound."
3105,Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker
3106,neat tool we enjoy it with the family
3107,Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.
3108,"I live alone, this is the best companion!"
3109,Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!
3110,"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!"
3111,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.
3112,This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*
3113,I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself
3114, 
3115,It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.
3116,I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.
3117,Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom
3118,"excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns"
3119,It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.
3120, 
3121,I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.
3122,I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.
3123, 
3124,"Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music."
3125,This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.
3126, 
3127,works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.
3128,Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great
3129,We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.
3130,Use the product for music and it’s great!
3131,Easy to set-up and to use.
3132,It works great!!
3133,I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.
3134,PHENOMENAL
3135,I loved it does exactly what it says
3136,I used it to control my smart home devices. Works great.
3137,Very convenient
3138,"Este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor, perdió toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol"
3139,Easy to set up Ready to use in minutes.
3140,Barry
3141, 
3142,My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.
3143,Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.
3144,love it
3145,"Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!"
3146,"Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up."
3147,"I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems."
3148,"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers."
3149,Good
